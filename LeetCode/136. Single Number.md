### Problem
- Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.
- You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int num: nums){
            res ^= num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
