## Useful Algorithms
### Arrays
1. [[sliding window]] (finding subarrays)
2. [[two pointer approach]] (searching for pairs)
3. [[Dynamic Programming]] (finding minimum combinations)
4. [[Binary Search]] (sorted list $O(\log n)$ time)
5. [[Backtracking]] (finding subsets)
### Graphs
1. [[Breadth First Search]] (finding levels to a graph)
2. [[Topological Sort (DFS)]] (traversing a directed acyclic graph (graph with no cycles))
3. [[Depth First Search]]
## Bits
### XOR `^=`
1. XOR with same number returns 0
2. XOR with 0 returns the number
3. Is commutative so order doesn't matter
4. Is associative so grouping doesn't matter
### bitshift `x = x>>1`
- use an `x&1` to test if smallest bit is 1
