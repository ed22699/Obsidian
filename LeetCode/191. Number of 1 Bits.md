### Problem
- Given a positive integerÂ `n`, write a function that returns the number ofÂ set bitsÂ in its binary representation (also known as theÂ [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int bits = 0;
        while(n>0){
            if((n&1) != 0) bits++;
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return bits;
    }
}
```
