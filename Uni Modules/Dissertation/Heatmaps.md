## Metrics For Initial Heatmap
- Heatmaps of: 
	- *median house price*
		- exclude areas under x amount of sales
		- median allows for
			- non-parametric tests
			- robustness against outliers
				- is suitable for skewed distributions and heteroscedastic areas
	- *volume of transactions*
	- *multi-year % change*
		- adjusted for inflation
- potential partitions:
	- postcodes (good for *training and general early use*)
		- capture population density
		- align with how housing markets behave
		- enough volume for reliable medians
		- aligns with existing demographic data
	- Geohashing (good for *deeper evaluation of attribute effects* on prices)
		- dynamic cell sizes depending on zoom level
	- LSOA (good for *report*)
		- common in academia 
		- government-designed for statistical use
		- spatially meaningful
		- population-balanced
