- useful to distinguish between
	- *Macroeconomics*: high-level impenetrable/mystical stuff
		- e.g. the relationship between a nation's inflation rate and unemployment levels
	- *Microeconomics*: just maths, much more useful for problem solving
		- is a set of theories with one aim: to help us gain an understanding of the process by which scarce resources are allocated among alternative uses, and of the role of prices and markets in this process
- there are lots of important resource-limited systems
	- e.g. telecoms, computer OS, staffing/timetabling
	- automating their control/regulation is attractive 
	- difficult for all the usual reasons
- ideas from microeconomics could help us do automated dynamic resource allocation and control in engineered systems
- MBC is not a radical new idea; initially explored in 1988, the ecology of computation 
- it happens that these automatically-optimised robot traders and market mechanisms, originally intended fro control of data centres, are of significant interest to major investment banks, buyside finds, and exchange operators

- shortage shown on a graph

- for surplus on a graph P will be higher than the equilibrium point
- opposing pressures balance out to the equilibrium point

- *Pareto efficient* is no one can be made better off without someone else being worse off

- posted offer - has a fixed price and the buyer either buys it or not, such as in retail

- where it extends up to the sky there is no price in which any more are available is at max quantity
- utility is difference between the limit price and the transaction price (is the saving on the sale)
	- bought at a x% margin (this is the utility difference)

- triangles are the utility margins
	- horizontal edge is the limit price
	- the point is the price plus the margin, what the trader would actually quote
- not true for very long
	- people leave the market once they have completed the transaction, so get removed from the graph

- margins may be constantly changing based on the situation of the market

- note that past the equilibrium point margins have been decreased whereas to the left they have been increased
## Experimental Economics
- laboratory-style studies of human market-trading behaviours
- small number of human subjects are split into buyer and seller groups
- all traders given a private-value limit price
	- buyers given sums of cash; can't buy above limit price
	- sellers given units of an arbitrary commodity; can't sell below limit price
- traders interact within some market mechanism
	- buyers may quote bid prices
	- sellers may quote offer prices
- demonstrated rapid equilibration in CDA with very small numbers of traders
- note: professional traders tend to do only slightly better than naive subjects

- how much of the allocative efficiency of a CDA is due to the intelligence of the traders, and how much of it is due to the organisation of the market?
- Gode and Sunder '93 introduced zero-intelligence (ZI) trading agents for CDA markets
	- ZI-U: unconstrained, generate random bid/odder quote prices
	- ZI-C: random quote prices, but constrained not to trade at a loss
- ran experimental economics tests with ZI-U, ZI-C and human traders in 5 different markets, monitored their allocative efficiency
	- ZI-U traders were plain useless
	- ZI-C traders were surprisingly human-like
- conclusions:
	- most of the intelligence is in the market, not in the traders
