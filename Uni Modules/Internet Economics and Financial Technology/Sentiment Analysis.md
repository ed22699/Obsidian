- *sockpuppet* is an online identity used for purposes of deception
	- poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the main account operator
	- use to praise, defend , or support a person or organisation, or to manipulate public opinion
	- use of many fake personas by one person or organisation can give a misleading impression of an opinion being held widely and diversely
	- work because people are strongly influenced by the opinions of others. Variants include:
		- ballot stuffing: submit multiple votes in online poll in favour of the puppeteer
		- sybil attack: multiple false identities used to create influence within a peer-to-peer online network
		- stealth marketing: multiple sockpuppets, each claiming to be an enthusiastic supporter of product/service/ideology
		- strawman sockpuppet: to make a particular point of view look foolish in order to generate negative sentiment against it; or to advance arguments that their puppeteers can easily refute
		- astroturfing: use sockpuppets to make a message appear as though it originates from, and is supported by, grassroots participants.
