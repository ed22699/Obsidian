## Three Degrees of Price Discrimination 
![[Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 22.38.54.png|400]]
- first degree
	- A personalised price means you could get more of that area under the curve i.e. more money by tailoring price to person

 - second degree
	 - versioning much easier to perform in the digital world

 - keep markets segmented to stop arbitrage (buyers cannot choose their group and cannot resell for profit)
## Requirements for price discrimination
- seller must satisfy three conditions
	1. distinguish between customers to know which price to charge to whom
	2. have enough market power to be able to set prices above marginal costs
	3. resale must be impractical, costly, or forbidden to prevent arbitrage
- for online producers, these conditions are often met, and adaptation of prices can often go unnoticed
	- online expect to see a lot of price discrimination

## Digital versioning
- buyers have choice, so less controversial than personalised pricing
- digital versions are used extensively and creatively
	- easier to prepare than physical versions: simply cut down functionality
	- near-zero cost to duplicate
- personalisation of product is versioning taken to the extreme and moves it to almost $1^{st}$ degree price discrimination
	- allow customers to construct their own most-valuable version
	- e.g. dell computes a pioneer (choose RAM, CPU, Disk, Monitor, etc.)
- economics, but also psychology
	- people tent to upsell towards the almost top option when offered multiple options
- the risk of versioning is that people willing to pay for the higher price version will go for the lower price one: i.e. competing with yourself

## Bundling
- selling of several goods together for a single price
- used to sell to customers who would otherwise not buy
- bundling can help keep monopoly control of a market
	- if a competitor wants to compete directly, it must offer all products in the bundle, which dramatically increases fixed development costs
	- consider the success of MS Office
