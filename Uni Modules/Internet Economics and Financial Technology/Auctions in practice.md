- Marshall's rules for dealing with economics
	1. translate mathematics into english
	2. illustrate by examples that are important in real life
	3. burn the mathematics
	4. if you can't succeed in 2, burn 1
- if we can't
	- offer credible intuition
	- supply empirical evidence
	- we should be cautious about applying the theory in practice
- two key implicit assumptions of the revenue equivalence theorem
	- all auction are equally attractive
	- there is no collusion between bidders
- attractiveness and robustness to collusion are important in practical auction design
- profitability depends on number of bidders who participate
	- participating can be costly, so bidder will only enter if they feel they can win
	- in ascending auctions, strong bidder can always top a weak bidder, so weak bidders may not enter
	- in first-price sealed-bid, a weaker bidder may win at a price the stronger bidder could have beaten, but didn't because they chose to shade
- profitability depends on auctions being robust to collusion
	- open auction help facilitate collusion through bids
	- sealed-bid auctions are more robust - can't observe other's bids, or punish defection during an auction
