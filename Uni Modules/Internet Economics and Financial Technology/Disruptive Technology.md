- you evaluate your technology performance compared to customer demands and you realise you will stay above that line, everything is good
- new technology appears with margins and performance worse than yours, smaller market
	- but may be lighter/cheaper/more-compact
- its all good your technology is better than the new technology it isn't taking your users
- issue when the customers needs are at the same level as the new technology
	- new technology now serves your market's needs, and hence it eats your lunch
## The Innovator's Dilemma
- distinguishes between two types of innovation
	- **Sustaining Innovations:** incremental improvements on existing products or services, attractive to existing customers (e.g. better price/performance) and existing business model (e.g. increase margins); eventually, you offer more than the customer wants
	- **Disruptive Innovations:** perform less well than existing products, may be lower quality and less sophisticated, but they are also simpler, cheaper, more user-friendly
		- disruptive innovations can cause strong incumbent companies to fail/falter, not because of weaknesses in those companies, but because they do the right short-term thing of serving the (higher-margin, higher-volume, market-leading) established technology to established customers, and leave the low end of the market to others, to preserve brand
- **The Dilemma:** doing what made the company a success in the first place can lead it to failure; a sequence of individually sensible business decisions can, in hindsight, appear to be disastrous
- **Implication:** sometimes successful incumbents need to invest in doing the wrong thing
- steps of how this occurs
	- disruptive technology is developed by the incumbent company
	- Incumbents company existing customers are unimpressed
	- incumbent company doesn't develop the disruptive technology, concentrates on sustaining innovations
	- new companies form (sometimes formed from disgruntled ex-employees of incumbent company) and develop new markets for the disruptive technology
	- as the disruptive technology matures and improves, it moves "up the chain"
	- incumbent company realises their is a significant new market, attempts to enter it as a latecomer, fails due to unassailable lead built up by new companies
