- Microeconomics: studies the *behaviour* of individuals and businesses and how decisions are made based on the allocation of *limited* resources
	- simplifies the picture to help analyse and predict market dynamics

- cycle of production and consumption
	- consumers: how much to pay and what to buy?
	- producers: how many to produce and what price to sell?
## Supply and Demand
- a balance with forces of supply and demand driving towards an equilibrium point
	- when quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied we are at an equilibrium
	- equilibrium point determines the price of the goods, is the *equilibrium price*
- *excess demand*: more demand than product
	- causes prices to rise (above equilibrium price)
	- makes some customers unhappy, rebalancing the demand and moving the price back to equilibrium
- *excess supply*: more supply than demand
	- firms fight to sell their surplus of goods, prices fall
	- producers will be unhappy and will produce less goods (or go out of business), moving price back to equilibrium
## Consumers
- value for a customer decreases with the quantity they obtain
	- there is a *marginal benefit*: benefit you receive from the last item obtained

- *law of diminishing marginal utility*
	- for a given product an individual will generally benefit less from each additional unit consumed

- different people have different marginal benefit curves but all have diminishing marginal utility
- the demand curve is the combined marginal benefit curves of all the customers
	- shows the relationship between price and total quantity demanded

- expenditure: 
- consumer surplus: additional benefit that individuals gain from purchasing the item above the price they actually payed
	- value to consumers in excess of expenditure
- gradient of demand curve tells us how much the quantity changes in response to change in price, *price elasticity of demand*

- horizontal demand: *perfect elasticity*
- vertical demand: *perfect inelasticity*
- 45 degrees: *unit elasticity* (% change in price equals % change in demand)
## Producers
- business costs money
	- premises, labour, equipment, etc
- *fixed costs*: a company must incur in order to operate. Fixed during a short time period
- *variable costs*: tend to rise with increased production (variable costs increase with every new item made)
- *semi-variable*: labour can be considered a variable cost (e.g. overtime or hiring more staff to handle increased workload) 
- total costs is the sum of both fixed and variable

- variable costs tend to be non linear
![[Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 19.01.59.png|400]]
- *marginal cost* (MC): cost of producing *last* unit
	- marginal cost equals the change in cost / change in quantity produced
	- MC initially falls then rises
