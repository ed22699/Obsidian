- term comes from a popular book of the same name
- old days
	- retailers make money
		- on high-volume low-margin goods (e.g. hotdogs)
		- on low-volume high-margin goods (e.g. Ferrari)
	- for *margin* $m$ and *volume* $v$ you can make $\$x$ via any $(m,v)$ that satisfies $m\cdot v = x$  
		- low-volume low-margin retail tended to be a loser's game
	- running a high-street or physical space cost money
		- want to maximise return on cost of shelf-space
			- stocking the available space with high-$(m\cdot v)$ goods
			- stocking, for any particular $m \cdot v$ point, what is most popular at that time
	- the larger the shelf-space, the shelf-space costs move to (almost) nothing
## Power-law distribution of popularity

- curve of the form $P=cR^{-v}$
- y-axis is sold per unit time
- x-axis is popularity rank
- it is *non-linear*
	- if you plot on a log log axis it will produce a straight line

- imagine you only have room for 10 items
	- stock the 10 most popular products
- what about the rest of the products?
	- missing out on the opportunity of selling the other 90 product types

- the web stores offered the obscure items that retail stores could simply not store

- these web stores that did not require pure physical goods had a much lower profit threshold
	- can more rapidly make a profit
	- can offer lower prices than the physical retailer

- use of recommendations can push customers to the more obscure, and hence further into the long tail

- turns out *the biggest money may be in the smallest sales* (done large-scale)
- rules
	- make everything available
	- reduce prices (economies of scale, elimination of Bricks and Mortar costs)
		- note "reduce prices" may have come at the cost of workers rights/pay
	- "Help me find it"
- amazon and other sites have made it also just as easy to buy used/pre-owned items as it is new ones
- amazon - makes money from long tail products
- eBay - sells many niche, one-off products
- google - makes most of its money from small advertisers

- some people have argued against the long tail analysis
	- some argue the web magnifies the importance of "blockbuster" hits
	- some argue the curve is better exhibited as a log-normal distribution rather than a power-law curve. Also reported that 80% of the music tracks they monitored sold no copies at all over a one-year period
- not a law in its self but has a strong logical observations to know
