- for physical space, an audience too thinly spread is the same as no audience at all
	- things need to be worth the cost of the shelf space
	- leads to the obscure not being displayed
- physical space is a world of scarcity, online world is one of abundance as shelf space is near negligible in this world
	- less popular things that aren't hits also make money, with the cheaper shelf space this is a viable option to server to customers
	- the long tail can actually make a lot of money
- this creates some rules
	1. Make everything available
		- in the long tail economy it is more expensive to evaluate than to release
	2. Cut the price in half. Now lower it
		- the main cost is building and maintaining the online service rather than the negligible storage and bandwidth costs
		- you need to price according to digital costs not physical ones
		- lower prices mean people tend to buy more. Rhapsody did an experiment where it offered 99 cents tracks and 49 cents tracks. 49 cents tracks sold three times as much despite only being half the price
		- pull the consumers down the tail with lower prices
		- a fair price can compete with the "free" version where people instead have to spend their time rather than their money
	3. Help me find it
		-  you need both ends of the curve
			- hits are needed to attract consumers in the first place
			- you then need to ease the exploration of the unknown drawing the consumer down the tail
