## Users
- users tend to be young
- users tend to be wealthy
- but survey was taken in wealthy countries, with mature banking industry, may be biased 
### Underbanked

- opportunity for fintech
- many regions of the world have significant populations with no access to banking facilities

## Financial Regulation
- *financial regulation*: authority rules or directives to control and manage services
	- a government/regulatory body
	- to protect actors (e.g. FSCS savings and deposit protection)
	- to improve efficiency (e.g. monopoly regulation/antitrust laws)
	- to reduce risk (e.g. ring-fencing retail banking from other banking activities)
	- to help build trust
- fintech/techfin is disruptive, so therefore may not initially be regulated
	- can delay progress and destroy an idea before it has time to grow
- some regulators take a "watch and see" approach (e.g. sandboxing)
- technology companies do not have expertise of regulatory compliance
- tend to move through three phases:
	- too small to care
	- too large to ignore
		- regulators must step in 
	- too big to fail
		- if company folds it will have an impact, government would need to step in if it were to fail

- upper-left: bank dominance
	- *traditional banking sector is already well established* and likely to continue to dominate
	- in-sector competition may create a positive dynamic of service innovation
	- nascent local tech ecosystem means *innovation may come from foreign FinTech*
- upper-right: partnering
	- *banks well entrenched* and serve most of population
	- *strong tech ecosystem* supports innovations (to disrupt incumbents)
	- banks can leverage tech to compete
	- some *FinTechs will scale*, others will *partner with banks*
- lower-right: tech dominance 
	- *well-developed tech eco-system*, while *banks underserve*
	- opportunities for non-bank innovators
	- *cross-sector convergence*: tech companies *obtain financial services licenses or partner with banks*, while banks seek new functionality via partnership with FinTechs
	- China has been relatively open to techfin. Ant financial has more than 340 million clients, 10 times more than served by any one of the world's largest banks - *development-led*
	- India demands financial services conducted by licensed and regulated institutions. Rules are now changing - *development-lagged*
- lower-left: race to the finish
	- *low levels of bank penetration* and *underdeveloped tech ecosystems*
	- telecom companies are the most significant local tech players - in some countries have led digitalisation of finance through mobile money products
	- *banks can catch up* if they innovate before telecoms corner the market
## LASIC: The principles of success
- financial technologies are digital services with a strong network effect
	- economics of online/digital goods is also true for financial technology
	- regulation is also a key factor
- success summarised through LASIC
	- low profit margin
		- internet age: information/services expected to be essentially free
		- necessary to be able to maintain a low profit margin
		- profit margins remain low at the user level, so high volumes are necessary
	- asset light
		- enables a low profit margin
		- allows scalability without incurring large fixed costs on assets
		- low marginal costs
		- free ride on existing infrastructure to minimise fixed costs
			- e.g. money transfer using SMS over existing mobile comms infrastructure 
	- scalable
		- technology and business model must scale to reap the benefits of the network effect
		- ensure scale does not compromise efficiency or increase costs
		- scale quickly if possible to keep ahead of rivals
	- innovative
		- products and operations must be innovative - ideally a new business model - to penetrate a new market
		- not possible to break into a market by offering the same product at slightly cheaper price
	- compliance-easy
		- low regulatory compliance enable innovation
			- trade off: customer protection
		- businesses that recieve incentives to aid inclusion have an advantage
		- first mover advantage - proven beneficial products may be allowed to proceed
		- develop-led regulation rather than development-lagged regulation
		- if identification remains an issue, scalability may be unattainable
			- use low-touch solutions such as SIM registration
			- mobile apps; bank account/ID only required for complex functions
