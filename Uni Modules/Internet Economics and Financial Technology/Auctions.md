## Why auctions
- price discrimination
	- what if seller has no idea what buyers are willing to pay?
	- use an auction: make buyers compete
	- aim to find buyer that is willing to pay the most
	- useful for a seller
## The English Auction
- open, ascending-price auction
	- public forum
	- price gets higher over time
- auctioneer starts by announcing a price
- if bidder happy will raise their hand
- auctioneer will confirm the bid is with the bidder with their hand raised
- auctioneer will announce higher price and repeats
- when no bidder is prepared to accept the item is sold to the person who last bid, at the price of that last bid
## The Dutch Auction
- sells lots of flowers
- open descending-price auction
- auctioneer starts by announcing price
- auctioneer will keep decreasing over time
- as soon as a bidder is prepared to accept the auctioneer's price, they quickly raise their hand
- this will stop the auction
- item will be sold to the first person who accepts, at the price that was accepted
 - much quicker to run, better for large quantities
