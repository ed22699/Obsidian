- internet has substantially disrupted the business landscape
- *combinatorial innovation*: components can be combined and recombined to create new products/services - has accelerated due to the internet
	- 1800s, standardised gears, pulleys, chains (revolutionised manufacturing)
	- internet revolution - innovations are rapidly distributed globally, many innovations are open-source (e.g. HTML) and standardisation is easier and more necessary
- economic laws have not fundamentally changed but the characteristics of online business activities can result in different markets
## Online economic activities
- *digital goods*
	- can be delivered online, but used locally 
	- MP3 music file
- *information goods*
	- value of the good is in the information it provides
	- online news
- *online purchasing of physical goods*
	- amazon delivery
- *online provision of services*
	- netflix
### Economic differences between digital and physical goods
- digital goods tend to be *costly to produce*, but *cheap to reproduced*
	- high fixed costs
	- low variable costs
- most of the production costs are *sunk*
	- can't be recovered
- *no capacity constraints*
	- no limit on number of times something can be reproduced 
- digital goods are ofter *experience goods*
	- customer doesn't know their value without using them
- very low *search costs*
	- searching online is easy
- often strong *positive network externalities*
	- value to you increases as more people use it
## Consumers
- *externality*: if production and consumption of a good/service affects a third party who was *not involved* in the transaction
	- *negative externality* imposes costs on others
		- e.g. pollution from factory
	- *positive externality* provides benefit to others
		- e.g. eduction 
	- *network externality*: act of buying product/service indirectly gives cost or value on all those who already own the same product/service
		- negative network externality: costs others
			- e.g. more cars mean road congestion
		- positive network externality: benefit others
			- *network effect* describes the positive
			- e.g. telephone makes you available for others to call
- *network effect*
	- more common and more pronounce in online world with digital goods

- for any fixed price, $p > 0$ there are *three* equilibrium points
![[Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 19.49.10.png|500]]
- the tipping point
	- is the *critical mass* necessary for success
## Switching Costs and Lock-In
- switching from one product to another can have additional costs
	- switching costs in digital world are common and often great
- when switching costs are very high, buyers can get *locked in*
	- bad for consumers
- sources of switching costs
	- training how to use the system
	- the network effect - convincing others to switch
	- setup costs
	- reduced service quality due to loss of information
## Producers

- if two companies are competing with identical digital products, as their variable costs are near-zero, competition will drive the price down to near-zero
- a new company won't want to risk competing with an existing company, because the setup costs are high compared with the possible profits
	- the risk is further enhanced by the network effect, as any new product must reach a critical mass of users, or it will fail
	- switching costs and lock-in mean that users are less likely to swap to the new product
- for commodity digital goods, there is a tendency towards monopoly 
- to succeed, companies must therefore focus on product differentiation or competing for emerging future monopolies
- innovation more important than efficiency
- *proprietary formats* are a powerful means of enforcing monopoly
	- e.g. .doc format is owned by Microsoft word
		- means high switching costs and users locked in
- adopting *industry-wide standards* allows a user network to be shared between providers
	- your part of the network is opened to competition
	- network effect of competitors's users give value to your users
	- value of the overall network increases to potential new users, bringing more customers overall
	- trade off - bigger pie overall, but your slice of the pie may become smaller
