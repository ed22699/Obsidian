- crowdsourcing: alternative to traditional companies/public sector bodies
	- for doing work / to solve a problem
	- citizen engagement
	- mass collaboration
	- crowd tasks
	- useful for tasks that are currently too difficult for a computer to perform
		- often tasks are tedious and repetitive (e.g. labelling images)
	- how to recruit
		- pay them
		- trick them into doing it implicitly, as a side effect of something they want to do, or have to do anyway
		- motivate volunteers to do it explicitly for free
			- make it worthwhile: with public benefit (e.g. zooniverse, wikipedia)
			- make it fun: gamification
