## Neurons
- computation in biological neural networks is delivered based on the co-operation of individual computational components, namely neuron cells

- basic operation of a neuron is a main flow of information known as a feed-forward, signals are decided whether or not to flow based off the logic of the nucleus, it will then travel down the axon when the axon terminals will communicate with the next layer via the synapse to the next neurons dendrites
- an environment can condition the behaviour of biological neural networks leading to the incorporation of new information (shown by Pavlov dog)
### Neuro-Plasticity
- plasticity refers to a system's ability to adapt structure and/or behaviour to accommodate new information
- brain shows various forms of plasticity
	- synaptic plasticity (mainly chemical)
	- structural sprouting (growth)
	- rerouting (functional changes)
	- neurogenesis (new neurons)
