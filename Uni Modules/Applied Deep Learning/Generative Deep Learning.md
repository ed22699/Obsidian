- *Discriminative Models (conditional models)*: a model that predicts knowledge about a task given data
	- given data $X$ and corresponding labels $Y$ learns a distribution $P(Y|X)$
- *Generative Models*: aim to model the distribution of the underlying data directly
	- i.e. a model that can generate 'new' data items
	- given data $X$ and corresponding labels $Y$ learns the distribution $P(X,Y)$
	- labelling are not required
- how can we check generated example belongs to the true distribution?
	- ask AI
	- asking AI to check is a problem and doesn't correspond with human analysis but data to check is too large to get around this issue
