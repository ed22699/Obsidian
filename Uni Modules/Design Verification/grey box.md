- limited number of DUV facilities are utilised in a mostly black-box environment
	- access important and stable features, the rest is kept in the dark
- combines the pros (or cons if done wrong) of black and white box
	- progression from black box to grey box should be carefully planned and started only when the DUV is sufficiently stable
- in practice most verification environments are grey box
	- may need to start with black box with planned evolution into grey box
	- prediction of correct results on an interface is occasionally impossible without viewing an internal signal
