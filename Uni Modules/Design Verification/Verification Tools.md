# Automation
Task of Verification Engineer:
- ensure product does not contain bugs - done efficiently and cost-effectively
Task of Verification Team Leader
- select/provide appropriate tools
- select a verification team
- decide when cost of finding next bug violates law of diminishing returns
Parallelism, abstraction and automation can reduce the duration of verification
- automation reduces the human factor, improving efficiency and reliability
- Verification tools are use to achieve automation
	- Dynamic Verification
		- Hardware verification languages (HVL)
		- test-bench automation
		- test generators
		- coverage collection and analysis
		- general purpose HDL simulators (event-driven, cycle-based or waveform viewers)
	- Static Analysis/Verification Methods (Formal Methods)
		- linting tools
		- equivalence checkers
		- model checkers
			- property specification languages (ABV)
		- theorem proves
	- Administration
		- version control and issue tracking
		- metrics
		- data management and data mining related to metrics
	- Third party models
