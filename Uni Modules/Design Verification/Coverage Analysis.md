goal (times covered), relates back to the yellow and green from previous lecture

non-overlapping sets
- arith uses the ALU
- branch uses the control flow

find large areas of uncovered tasks - important because
- if they are similar to each other you might be able to get them in the same test, greater investment of time
- coverage tool presenting the graph is useful in finding these large areas, not very readable is table form
- aggregation algorithm helps find these smaller areas after you are finished with the larger areas
