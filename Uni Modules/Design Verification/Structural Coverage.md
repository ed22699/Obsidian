yellow is lightly covered, you have been there but not very often (e.g. less than 5 time)

how big is the coverage space 
- the product of all commands - combinations for commands and responses $31$x$16 = 496$ 
- $A$x$B = \{(a,b)|a\in A \cap b \in B\}$ 
	- if $A=\{x,y\}$, $B={0,1}$ then $A$x$B=\{(x,0),(x,1), (y,0),(y,1)\}$
	
get to an illegal space, have I misinterpreted the problem - use more checkers

give simplest one you can think of - give like 3 or 2 domains

focus on data signals. Control signals if they were 32 bits wide it would be $2^{32}$ cases
