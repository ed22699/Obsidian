- internal facilities of the DUV are known, visible and utilised for verification
- pros
	- full visibility and controllability of internal signals
		- can identify and cover corner cases
		- can detect bugs as soon as they occur
	- quickly possible to set up interesting conditions, e.g. counter roll-over
- cons
	- danger to follow the implantation/design instead of the specification
	- sensitive to changes in the DUV (implementation)
	- too many details make it hard to create and maintain
