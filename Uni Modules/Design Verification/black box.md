- has inputs, outputs, and performs some (well documented) function
- to verify a black box, you need to understand the function
- the verification code utilises only the external interfaces
- the internal signals and state remain in the dark
- Pros
	- no knowledge of the actual implementation is required
	- ability to predict functional results based on inputs alone ensures that the reference model remains independent from the DUV implementation
	- verification code is less sensitive to changes inside the DUV
- Cons
	- difficult to locate source of problem, only exposes effects (however not all bugs propagate to the outputs)
	- lacks controllability and observability
