# Observability and Controllability
- Observability
	- how easy it is to tell the difference between well designed and poor design
	- black box: nothing visible
	- white box: everything visible
	- grey box: some visible
- Controllability
	- how easy to set up so I can focus on the design
	- problem of unreachable states - testing things that will never be reachable in practice (finding bugs that don't exist), can lead to people in the design team not taking you seriously
