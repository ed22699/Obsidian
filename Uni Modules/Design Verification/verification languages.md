- created to address verification principles
- HDLs had issues for verification:
	- Verilog was designed with a focus on describing low-level hardware structures
		- no support for data structures
		- not object/aspect-orientated
			- not good for testbenching
	- VHDL designed for large design teams
- limitations of HDLs inhibit efficient implementation of verification strategy
- high-level verification languages 
	- System Verilog
		- the IEEE standard
	- e-language
	- Synopsys' Vera, System C didn't make it
### Features of High-Level Verification Languages
- raise level of abstraction
	- from bits/vectors to high-level data types/structures
- support for building the verification environment
	- enable testbench automation
	- modularity
		- object/aspect oriented languages
		- libraries to enable re-use
- support for test generation
	- constrained random test generation features
		- control over randomisation to achieve the target values
		- advanced: connection to DUV to generate stimulus depending on DUV state
- support for coverage
	- language constructs to implement functional coverage models
### Other Verification tools
- waveform viewers
	- used to visually inspect design/[[testbench]]/verification environment
	- decreases the performance of simulator 
		- high memory and storage usage 
		- I/O overhead
		- slow rendering and display (visualisation bottlenecks)
		- can improve with:
			- selective signal tracing (only log important signals), reduce waveform data size
			- use compression to compress waveform data reducing storage and I/O overhead
			- waveform filtering (filter to focus on the specific time ranges or events of interest)
			- post-processing tools to reduce memory and performance overhead
	- bad for determine whether the DUV passes or fails a test
		- waveform viewers should not be used as a test cause hard to read and some parts may be overlooked
	- can be good for debugging
- third party models
	- chip needs to be verified in its target environment (Board/SoC verification)
	- buying behavioural models (specs) for board pars is expensive however model you develop is not as reliable as the one you buy as model bought is used by many others
	- often more expensive to develop your own model to the same degree of confidence than licensing one
- metrics
	- not really verification tools by managers love metrics and measurements
	- managers want something measurable to assess progress
	- metrics include:
		- coverage
		- number of lines of code
		- ratio of line of code (between design and verification)
		- drop of source code changes
		- number of outstanding issues
