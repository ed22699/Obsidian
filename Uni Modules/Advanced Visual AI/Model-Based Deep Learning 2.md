## Iterative soft thresholding algorithm (ISTA)

## Image fusion
- you may have different types of images holding different information about an object. You can take these images and represent them in a different domain to merge the data into a single image that is directly manageable 
- pixel
	- just take corresponding pixels
- region
	- segment the image and fuse together multiple images at the same time
- compressive fusion
	- compare the two and pick the one with the higher magnitude, or average them, or weighted average scheme (next slide)
