- if you are doing [[Inverse Problems]] you can tell how well you have enhanced the image by dividing it from the original, a good enhancement should show only noise in this output

- when we split x into x and v it means we can minimise both parameters separately

- you adapt your method depending on the amount of domain knowledge and data you have
