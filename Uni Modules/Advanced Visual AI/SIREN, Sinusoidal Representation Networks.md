- SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Networks) is a neural network architecture that uses sinusoidal activation functions:
	- $f(x,y) = \sin(W\cdot x +b)$
	- where 
		- $f$ is the SIREN output
		- $W$ is a weight matrix
		- $b$ is a bias term
	- allows the network to capture oscillations across the input space
- *derivative of a SIREN is a SIREN*
	- periodic activations (e.g. sine functions) allow for continuous and smooth first and second-order derivatives
	- essential for applications like differentiable rendering
