- RARE: Regularisation by Artifact-Removal
- RARE uses the ideas of DIP and DeepRED but is trained instead on *multiple images*
- *Idea*: RARE extends RED beyond priors trained for the removal of AWGN by considering those trained for more general artifact removal
- leads to RARE's ability to learn imaging priors that requires no fully-sampled ground truth data
$$
\hat x =\arg \min_{x} \frac 1 2||y-Hx||_2^2 + \frac \lambda 2 x^T (x-R_\theta (x))
$$
- RARE replaces the denoiser in RED by an artifact-removal network $R_\theta$, where $\theta$ denotes the weights of the CNN
- starting with an initial solution $x^0 = R_\theta (H^ \dagger y)$, with $H^\dagger$ being the pseudoinverse of $H$, RARE iteratively solves the above equation
- $R_\theta$ is not one with a fixed input, $z$, as in DIP so needs to be trained
- Training without ground truth: the *Artifact2Artifact (A2A) strategy*
- consider a set of unknown images $\{x_j\}$, each acquired multiple times
$$
y_{ij}=H_{i,j}x_j + n_{ij}
$$
- where
	- $i$ is the index of the specific acquisition
	- $H_{i,j}$ represents the specific forward operator
- artifact contaminated images can be generated by applying the pseudoinverse of the measurement operator
$$
\hat x_{ij}= H^\dagger _{ij}y_{ij}
$$
- artifact removal network can be trained through an empirical loss function minimisation
$$
\arg \min_\theta \sum_{i,j,i',j'} \mathcal L (R_\theta (x_{ij}), \hat x _{i'j'})
$$
