- Each input is pared with an output - a "label" or "target" - and the model is trained to minimise the error (difference) between its output and the target
- Tasks:
	- Regression: numerical outputs
	- Classification: category labels
- Methods:
	- Supervised neural networks
	- Support vector machines
	- Decision trees
