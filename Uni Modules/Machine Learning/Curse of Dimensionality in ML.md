- 1D and 2D spaces can be covered by data easily, higher dimensions no longer feasible as exponentially large quantity of data is required to fill the data in all cells
- often possible to find effective algorithms for two reasons
	- Data is often restricted to specific regions of the much bigger spaces (effective dimensionality is much smaller)
	- Data typically has smoothness properties (small changes in input variables will lead to small changes in output variables)
