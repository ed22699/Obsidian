# Perceptron (simplified neural network)
- directly inspired by how neurons process information

- example of [[Linear Discriminant Function]] given by $y(x) = f(w^{T}\phi(x))$ with a nonlinear activation function$f(a) = \begin{cases} +1 & a \geq 0 \\ -1 & a < 0\end{cases}$
- target $t=\{+1, -1\}$
- aim to minimise the following error: $-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\boldsymbol{w}^{T}\phi_{n}t_{n}$
- 



multilayer the w's are different diagram slightly wrong
