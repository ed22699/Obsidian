- p = "the probability of observing results this extreme, if $H_0$ is true"
- when p is low, we have good evidence to reject $H_0$
- when p = 0.05, we'll wrongly reject $H_0$ only once every 20 times
- speaks to *whether or not an effect exists, but not it practical significance*
- large sample sizes can reduce sample variation and lower p values, so a significant difference between two samples may be very small
