- provide a portal for explicit data acquisition, and are generally less prone to the issues from HTML scraping as:
	- code is optimised for retrieval and not for visual layout/aesthetics
	- standard serialisation tools (e.g. JSON) are typically used
	- the core items of interest have been extracted (e.g. dates, URLs)

- web APIs, although similar in principle, will have very different schemas
- writing code for APIs is generally simpler than parsing HTML, requires less maintenance, are often documented, and results in faster overall code
