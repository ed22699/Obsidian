- $k^{th}$ $q$-quantile is where the cumulative distribution function crosses $k/q$:
	- $q$ specifies the number of quantiles, $k$ indexes over these $P[X \geq x] \geq 1 - \frac k q$
- the only 2-quantile is called the median
- the 4-quantiles are called quartiles $Q$; the difference between upper and lower quartiles is also called the interquartile range, mid-spread or middle fifty $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$
- the 100-quantiles are called percentiles $P$
