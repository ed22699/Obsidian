- modern data problems often involve many-to-many relationships with heterogeneous data.
- graph is a set of vertices and edges: G=(V,E)
- essentially a collection of very simple data structures that can be navigated efficiently

- has the advantage of enabling graph theory tools to be applied to a complex web of relationships
