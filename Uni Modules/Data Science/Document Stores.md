- Like a key-value store, but one that restricts values to semi-structured formats. such as JSON documents
- fetch an entire document by its ID
- Retrieve only parts of a document
- execute queries like
	- aggregation
	- query-by-example
	- even full-text search 
- a use case could be e.g. a website's shopping cart: retrieve product details for every product in your cart
