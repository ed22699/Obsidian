- distributed multi-level sorted map involving several levels of keys
	- first-level keys (*row keys*) identify rows, consisting of key-value pairs
	- second-level keys are called *column keys*, organised in *column families*
- efficient space utilisation
	- no keys without value, nulls take 0 space
- stored in lexicographic order by key
	- enables high compression rate
	- efficient query of row subsets
- cells can be versioned
