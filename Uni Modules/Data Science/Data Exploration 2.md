## Descriptive vs inferential statistics
- Inferential/inductive:
	- summarise sample
	- based on probability theory
- descriptive:
	- describe or summarise dataset
	- useful for assessing data quality, developing models, general understanding
	- often presented alongside conclusions inferential statistics
- Univariate measures
	- central tendency (mean, median, mode)
	- variability (variance, quartiles, min, max, kurtosis, skewness)
	- graphical/tabular format (histograms)
## Types of variable
- categorical/discrete (qualitative)
	- nominal
	- ordinal: ordered
	- dichotomous: only two categories
- continuous (quantitive)
	- interval: measured along a continuum and numerical value
		- e.g. temperature measured in celsius or fahrenheit
	- ratio: added condition that 0 indicates that there is none of that variable
		- e.g. temperate measured in Kelvin
