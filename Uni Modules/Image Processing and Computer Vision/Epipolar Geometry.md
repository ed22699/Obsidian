[[Stereo Geometry]]

don't know the depth, you do know that it lies along the line - epipolar line
- every point in the left camera has a corresponding line in the right
if you take points from the right camera and project into the image plane you get an epipolar line for the left camera which is different. 
An epipolar plane is 
epipole - where the line cuts the image plane
