- Image processing is the digital manipulation of an image to enhance it or extract some useful information from it for further processing
- Computer vision attempts to bridge the semantic gap between pixels and their meanings
$$
Pixels \to Features \to Models \to Meaning
$$
## Challenges
- View-point variation (the angle)
- Illumination
- Occlusion (things in front of others)
- Scale
- Deformation ----
- Background clutter ------
- Object intra-class variation (variations of an object type)
- Local ambiguity (similar looking images)

## [[Shannon's Sampling Theorem]] ------
## Modelling a Spatial Brightness Pulse - Dirac Delta-Function ----
