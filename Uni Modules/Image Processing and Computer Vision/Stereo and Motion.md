parallax - the closer things are in the frame the quicker they move
disparity - the further things are away the less far they move in the frame

whats in the scene, where the cameras are can cause problems
- self-occlusion
- shadows and lighting changing appearance 
- different things look the same

$d$ is inversely proportional to the depth of that point
multi-view stereo, take a video of the scene combine the views to get better estimates
- some views can't see certain points, tricky

geometry of cameras relative to each other (can use a rig so you do not need to estimate)
correspondence is an image processing task
interrelated, knowing one can help the other
