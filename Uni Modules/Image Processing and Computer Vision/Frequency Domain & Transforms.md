# Signals as Functions
frequency - allows us to characterise signals
- repeats over regular intervals with frequency $u=\frac{1}{T}$ cycles/sec (Hz)
- amplitude $a$ (peak value)
- the phase $\theta$ (shift in degrees)

## Frequency Domain
- $F(u,v)$ is a complex number and has real and imaginary parts: $F(u,v)
