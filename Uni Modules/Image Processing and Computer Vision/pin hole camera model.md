- origin is the centre of projection
- principal point is where the object cuts the image plane
- perspective projection equations you have:
	- 3D point $\boldsymbol{P}=(X,Y,Z)$ on surface of object
	- projects to 2D point $\boldsymbol{p}=(x,y,f)$ in image
	- using triangles $x=\frac{fX}{Z}$, $y=\frac{fY}{Z}$ 
	- so $\boldsymbol{p}=f\frac{\boldsymbol{P}}{Z}$
