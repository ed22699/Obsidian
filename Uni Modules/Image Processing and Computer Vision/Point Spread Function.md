- ideally, the optical system should be mapping point information to points again, however, optical systems are never ideal
- superposition principle : an image is the sum of the PSF of all its points
if $f(x,y)$ is the original, $g(x, y)$ is the blurry outcome and $h(x,y)$ is the PSF of the imaging device, the following equation is true $g(x,y)=f(x,y)\cdot h(x,y)$
