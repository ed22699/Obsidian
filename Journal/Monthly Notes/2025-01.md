# What do you want to achieve
## Months Goal Breakdown
[[Van Build]]:
- Create a base of general answers without focusing on individual questions
- Do this via researching different blogs/forums
- Aim to have extracted information from at least 3 different sources 
[[Reading]]:
- Finish the [[Unity in Action Third Edition - Joe Hocking]] book
[[Coding]]/[[Startup]]:
- Build a good and complete design and requirements doc for the timer app second iteration
## Why
[[Van Build]]:
- I need a base in which to start so I can create more specified searches
[[Reading]]:
- I need to be competent enough to create a game/teach Jack and Charlie by the end of the month when development should be underway
[[Coding]]/[[Startup]]:
- This will save time as I can build a more robust system with more independent modules, leading to easier updates
