![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
1. Make notes on some of the blogs from the Absolute Lucy blog[^1]
2. Create a requirements document, taking some inspiration from the prototype timer app. Aim to be near completion end of week[^2]
3. Read [[Unity in Action Third Edition - Joe Hocking]] book with notes up to page 325 [^3]
	- this is 207 pages so 30 pages a day
4. Log your energy throughout the day to try and find consistencies on when you have the most energy
5. Sort finances
## Why
1. To add to ideas and problems from someone who is in this type of life, adding a base to work off in later weeks 
2. Proper planning is required to make this version robust and easy to implement a payed model on top. A thorough design phase should be required but for this a requirements document is needed
3. Project will begin end of this week
4. Want to know when to do my important work
5. need a general idea/checkup
