![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
1. Make notes on some of the blogs from the Absolute Lucy blog[^1]
2. Create a requirements document, taking some inspiration from the prototype timer app. Aim to be near completion end of week[^2]
3. Read [[Unity in Action Third Edition - Joe Hocking]] book with notes up to page 325 [^3]
	- this is 207 pages so 30 pages a day
4. Log your energy throughout the day to try and find consistencies on when you have the most energy
5. Sort finances
## Why
1. To add to ideas and problems from someone who is in this type of life, adding a base to work off in later weeks 
2. Proper planning is required to make this version robust and easy to implement a payed model on top. A thorough design phase should be required but for this a requirements document is needed
3. Project will begin end of this week
4. Want to know when to do my important work
5. need a general idea/checkup 
# Outcome
1. did not complete, had a lot on my mind with breaking up with Efa
2. completed the document and am now onto design
3. didn't manage this, with note taking reading this book is very time consuming, read 97 pages (also stopped reading on the weekend cause sad)
4. logged for 4 days, didn't find much of a trend, feel I need to try it when there is a more consistent schedule. However, basic trends were:
	1. around 3pm I get tired and want a nap, after this I typically have a large burst in energy
	2. I have a burst of energy around 7pm
5. sorted, understand it better

## Improvements
- create a more disciplined structure within my routine, this will likely only come from habit so need to maybe schedule these tasks into my day at more consistent times 
- the main drop in this week came after the breakup which is understandable so don't look into this weeks metrics too deeply
