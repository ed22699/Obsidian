# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
1. Make notes on some of the blogs from the Absolute Lucy blog[^1]
2. Evaluate the current app, research good stats to implement, begin design document[^2]
## Why
1. To add to ideas and problems from someone who is in this type of life, adding a base to work off in later weeks 
2. Proper planning is required to make this version robust and easy to implement a payed model on top. A thorough design phase should be required 
# Outcome
