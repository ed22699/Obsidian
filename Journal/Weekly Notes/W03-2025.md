![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
1. Make some sort of progress on the van document [^1]
2. Read 50 pages this week (7 pages a day) [^2]
3. Do the majority of the design document (everything but the wireframes) [^3]
4. Create a schedule which includes your habits to be used next week for a test run
## Why
1. Has fallen off and needs any momentum possible
2. Back at uni so will be more busy, due to getting into the swing of things a taper is understandable
3. You want to keep progress going on this app
4. More consistent time will make the habits stick better
# Outcome
