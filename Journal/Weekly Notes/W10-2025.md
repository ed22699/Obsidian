![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
- complete up to timer
- talk to Efa and come to some resolution
## Why
# Outcome
- we didn't get what we want, we didn't even get a no, just silence, not even a read notification. Sonny you feel better then you try to get her back, it doesn't work, stop trying, sometimes the people we need don't need us. It sucks but its life, remember Icarus, don't reach for happiness as you just fall into despair, fly within the productive measures of content
