![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
1. Finish component design so wireframes can begin next week [^1]
2. Read 5 pages a day (35 pages total)
3. Do an hour run and complete all other aims
## Why
1. Component design is as important as wireframes and requires some focus
2. 5 is sustainable with a book that requires both reading and coding at the same time
3. You need to be better, you need to lock the fuck in
