![[Goals]]
# What do you want to achieve
## Goal Breakdown
- finish task display
- try to accept it is over with Efa and you will never have the opportunity to see if all your changes and growth would have fixed it all the second time around
## Why
# Outcome
- so close to finishing now just need to write the tests, ensure refreshes occur on certain points and better format the deletion
- messaged Efa to get closure, basically realised relationships go 2 ways and its not all my fault. I asked her to tell me she didn't love me and didn't want to fix things so I could move on and she didn't respond which showed a real lack of emotional maturity, if she respected me she would have the dignity to allow me to move on, this made me realise she isn't actually in a position where I want her back, I tried and I reflected and took accountability for my mistakes but I don't think she has, she hasn't grown within her emotional maturity she still needs to change and as is, right now even if she wanted, you shouldn't take her back, it hurts but thats reality, it just wouldn't be healthy for you.
- Broke my toe again. Woops
