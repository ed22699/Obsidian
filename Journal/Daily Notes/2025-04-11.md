## Mountain thoughts
I thought I was accepting the break up and the fact that we are not getting back together, I thought of it like a riptide, all I have been doing is swimming back to shore, messaging her and asking for her back as its what you naturally want to do but it only results in me being pushed further out to sea, ultimately resulting is more distance and hatred towards me on Efas part, I need to stop resisting the facts and swim sidewards, work on myself for me, not just to get her back and alter the point to which I swim if I want to get though it all. I thought that was clear but I had a sexual dream about her last night and without the distractions of my phone I just spiralled into thinking about her the whole day, all I wanted was to text her and tell her that right now in that moment I would her only physically, I would neglect my emotions to fuck her like I used to, for the majority of the day I was thinking about this and was hard, thats not right, thats not growth nor excepting facts, it is just looking for another excuse for her to come back into your life, again you try to swim towards the shore.

Sonny I want you to not message her until 2 weeks pre-Henley trials at the earliest if at all, there is no reason to message her and you shouldn't, you need to let her be without you. Please try to fucking accept that. I know you may always want her back, always feel like a part of you is missing but you took a risk and gave that part away and I know you don't regret that as it resulted in some of the best memories of your life, and ultimately the biggest lessons. She was your first true love and I don't know if there will ever be another but we need to keep moving
