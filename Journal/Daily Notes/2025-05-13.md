# Actions towards weekly goal
# Todays goals
- was a rough one today, let emotions get the better of me, messaged efa was very pissed off that the two things I asked for back where the two things she didn't give me. I understand now that I need to let her go, I am not deserving or a second chance and todays actions can't change yesterdays. I need to go to therapy.
