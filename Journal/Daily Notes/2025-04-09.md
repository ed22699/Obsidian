## Mountain thoughts 
I struggled so much with losing Efa because I made every change to be better for her, I felt I had changed enough for a second chance, that it was unfair that she didn't want me back, however the fundamental idea I missed in this is the fact that a strangers concept of you is a stale copy of your past self, you can make all the changes in the world but you can never change that copy. You can't force change. I will always want the real Efa I don't think that will go away, however, I am content with the copy of her I have in my memories. I made a lot of changes to be better but the one change I can't make is my feelings towards her, I had a plan I was going follow these 10 habits, change for the better for her and get her back. I was going to do this for 77 days and if I still couldn't have her then I would accept that there would be no fixing things, I would disappear into the mountains for a week, reflect on everything and when I returned I would move on. You can't force feelings, they don't stick to a plan, like it or not I am not ready to move on and I feel forcing that change would both break my morals and ideals and damage me I think it is best to focus on myself and be patient, one day another will come around and I will start something new and maybe then I can move on but I cannot force this.
