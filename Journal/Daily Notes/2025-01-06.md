# Actions towards weekly goal
# Todays goals
- read 30 pages 
- look into the feasibility of eye detection
	- basically it will be very hard. Will likely take this flow
		1. detect eyes
		2. inv binary threshold to detect iris/pupil 
		3. use this to find the position of the iris/pupil relative to the camera
		4. Form of stereo geometry to figure out where the eyes are looking relative to the camera
	- after all this you also have to integrate it so the python will work with the c#, this will also need to be quick which is challenging as the game itself will be taking up a lot or resources 
- pay rent
### Ideal
- begin document for requirements
- look into ISA and bonds
