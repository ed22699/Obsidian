## The Normal Distribution
- normal distribution is bell-shaped, with a maximum
- it is symmetric around the maximum
- its tails converge asymptotically to the x-axis
- maximum is in the middle of the curve
- the arithmetic mean, median and mode are equal

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac 1 2(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$
- where 
	- $f(x)$ is the function value at the point $x$, i.e. the value on the $y$-axis at the position of the respective $x$-value
	- $\mu$ is the mean of the normal distribution
	- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the normal distribution
	- $\pi$ is pi
	- $e$ is Euler's number
- a normally distributed variable can be characterised as follows:
$$
X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)
$$
- increasing the mean causes the normal distribution curve to shift to the right
- increasing the standard deviation causes it to widen
## The $z$-Value and the Standard Normal Distribution
- we can standardise each normal distribution so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
$$Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
- where 
	- $z$ is the standardised value (the $z$-value)
	- $x$ is the value of the distribution to be standardised 
	- $\mu$ is the mean value of the distribution
	- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution
