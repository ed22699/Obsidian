- hypothesis is just a translation of the research question into a testable statement
- with a hypothesis we generate statistically validated knowledge
- a hypothesis is a sound testable statement formulated with the help of theory and previous knowledge. 
- In the research process, we can also refer to the hypothesis as the research hypothesis
## The Null Hypothesis $H_{0}$ and the Alternative Hypothesis $H_{A}$
- the null hypothesis is always the testable statement
- the alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis
- the null hypothesis is typically the opposite of the research hypothesis
## Hypotheses, Directional or Non-directional?
- in non-directional hypotheses, the direction is not specified, while in directional hypotheses, the direction is also specified
- the null hypothesis includes not only the opposite of the alternative hypothesis but also the equality sign
## How to Formulate a Good Hypothesis
- should be an extension of the research question
- hypotheses have to be formulated as a statement, not as a question
- a good hypothesis reflects the existing literature and theory
- a hypothesis must be brief and meaningful
- the hypothesis must be testable
