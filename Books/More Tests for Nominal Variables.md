- the test procedures for nominal data are often called $\chi^2$-tests
- $H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2 = 0.5$
- $H_A: \pi_1 \neq \pi_2 \neq 0.5$
$$
U = \sum \frac{(f_i - e_i)^2}{e_i}
$$
- where
	- $f_i$ are the observed values
	- $e_i$ are the theoretically expected values
	- $\chi^2$-distributed with $df = c
