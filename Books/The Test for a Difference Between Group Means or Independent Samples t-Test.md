## The Test Distribution and the Test Statistic
$$
t = \frac{\bar x_1 - \bar x _2}{\hat \sigma_{\bar x_1, \bar x_2}}
$$
- where 
	- $t$ is the t-value of the t-distribution
	- $\bar x_1$ and $\bar x_2$ are the sample means of the respective groups
	- $\hat \sigma_{\bar x_1, \bar x_2}$ is the estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution
- if we take a closer look at the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
$$
\hat \sigma_{\bar x_1, \bar x_2} = \sqrt{[\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}][\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 \times n_2}]}
$$
- where
	- $n_1$ and $n_2$ is the number of observations of the respective groups
	- $s_1$ is the standard deviation of the sample of the first group
	- $s_2$ is the standard deviation of the sample of the second group
## The Critical t-Value
- determine using the t-distribution table and the degrees of freedom
## The t-Value and the Decision
- fill in our test statistic with the required values, using the t-value make the test decision
## The Effect Size
$$
r = \sqrt{\frac}
