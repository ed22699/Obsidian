## Mixing two patterns of the same design
- when combining two patterns of the same design, the size of each should be as different from the other as possible, otherwise the similarity will produce an optical illusion of movement or vibration
## Mating two checks
- once again need a healthy contrast between the scale of each
## Mixing two different patterns
- with two different patterns ensure similar scale in both
- if in doubt choose larger over smaller for the second prominent pattern
- if its a very small pattern the other must be significantly larger
## Mixing three patterns
- keep the contrast and scale consistent throughout the three patterns
### Mixing three patterns when two are the same
- the two like designs must be separated in size while the unlike pattern needs to be visually compatible with both
### Mixing three patterns of the same design
- very difficult
- scale must work overtime 
	- sometimes go easier when graduating in size from small out to large
## Mixing four patterns
- the more imagination and taste one puts into his appearance, the more subtle the results should be
