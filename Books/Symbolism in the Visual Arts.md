2. Archetypes in Art
	- Ancient art: religious symbols, myths, fertility goddesses.
	- Medieval art: Christian symbolism, mandalas in church architecture (rose windows).
	- Modern art: fragmentation, abstraction, surrealism — reflecting the disoriented modern psyche.
3. Symbolic Themes
	- **Circle/Mandala:** order, wholeness, the Self.
	- **Labyrinth/Maze:** the search for meaning, the journey of individuation.
	- **Light/Dark imagery:** tension of opposites, shadow vs. consciousness.
4. Art as Healing
	- Artistic creation can be a personal individuation process.
	- Even amateur artistic expression (painting, drawing dreams) brings unconscious material to light.
