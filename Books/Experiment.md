- break down the vision into its component parts
	- look for a value hypothesis, a metric to gauge if the product is actually providing value to customers
	- growth hypothesis, tests how new customers will discover a product or service
- questions:
	1. do consumers recognise that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
	2. if there was a solution, would they buy it?
	3. Would they buy it from us?
	4. Can we build a solution for that problem?
- identify the assumptions and figure out ways to test them
