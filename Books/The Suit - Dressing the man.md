## The Silhouette
- 4 archetype silhouettes
	- English look: 
		- took lead from royalty 
		- modelled itself along the lines of the military uniform. Adhering closely to the body, with subtle emphasis on the chest and a soft shoulder, the silhouette's marked waist, slightly flared skirt and deep side vents, trimmed sleeves and trouser line gave a man a firm, almost regal bearing
	- America (Ivy league look):
		- three-button, single-breasted jacket with natural shoulders, undarted fronts, flap pockets, centre vent, and plain-front trousers.
		- soft-spoken calculated anonymity
	- European:
		- revolved around Italian, and to a lesser extent, French fashion
		- relied on severity of line to project its style
		- high squarish shoulders and short overall length, jacket demanded small, high armholes to give the chest the length that short jackets denied it. Cut close through the chest and hips, the coat was usually single-breasted, two-buttoned with high notched lapels and slimming flapless pockets, and a ventless back. Trousers had a lower rise with figure-hugging legs
	- American English:
		- higher armholes and a smaller chest with darted fronts for a more shaped waist
		- emphasised the V-shape
