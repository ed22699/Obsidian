### Layout

- Scene tab - position objects in the current scene
- Toolbar - controls for working with a scene
- Hierarchy tab - drag and drop object relationships
- Inspector - lists information about selected objects, including linked code
- Console tab - test playing in Game view while watching error output
### Views
1. scene view is where you can see what the game world looks like and move objects around
> [!note]
Mesh object is a visual object in space

2. game view - when the game is running, what you see in this view is the game
- you can switch between these two views while the game is running, this can be useful for debugging
