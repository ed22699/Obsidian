- Three types of people will thrive in this society:
	- High skilled workers: People who can work well with the machines
	- Super stars: The top people who are known to be proficient in their field
	- Owners: The people funding these companies
- the two required abilities to thrive:
	- ability to quickly master hard things
	- the ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed
- deliberate practice requires:
	- attention focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master
		- quick mastery requires intense focus without distraction
		- 
	- you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it is most productive
