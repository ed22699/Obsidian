## Colour
- black dress shoes considered good for dark dressy suitings 
	- but dark brown offers equal refinement, if not better
## Putting your best foot forward
- the oxford shoe
	- basic style for smart, though not strictly formal town wear
- the wing-tip brogue
- the blucher
- the dress slip-on
- the side-gusset shoe
	- very stylish and comfortable but hard to find
