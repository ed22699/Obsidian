- Hero myths
	1. miraculous but humble birth
	2. early proof of superhuman strength
	3. his rapid rise to power
	4. triumphant struggle with forces of evil
	5. fallibility to the sin of pride
	6. fall through betrayal/heroin sacrifice
	- in many the early weakness of a hero is balanced by the appearance of strong tutelary figures who enable him to perform superhuman tasks that he could not accomplish unaided, Theseus had Poseidon 
		- "god like figures are in fact symbolic representations of the whole psyche ... supplies the strength that the personal ego lacks"
		- "The essential function of the heroic myth is the development of the individual's ego-consciousness ... the hero's symbolic death becomes as it were, the achievement of that maturity"
	- "The image of the hero evolves in a manner that reflects each stage of the evolution of human personality"
- Sometimes the hero myths are split into a single section
	1. Trickster cycle
		- lacks purpose beyond the gratification of his primary needs, he is cruel, cynical and unfeeling
		- assumes the form of an animal (usually a coyote) at the end of his rogue's progress he is beginning to take the physical likeness of a grown man
	2. Hare cycle
		- first appears in animal form, not yet altered mature human stature, appears as the founder of human culture - the transformer
		- distinct advance on trickster, becoming a socialised being, corrects the instinctual and infantile urges found in the trickster cycle
	3. Red horn cycle
		- passing tests, has a powerful companion who near the end of the story departs leaving red horn on earth. The danger to man's happiness and security now comes from man himself
	4. Twin cycle
		- separated at birth it is necessary to unite them
			- Flesh (introvert) - acquiescent, mild and without initiative. Main strength lies in power of reflection
			- Stump (extrovert) - dynamic and rebellious. Man of action who can accomplish giant deeds
		- eventually sicken from the abuse of their own power
	- for both twins and red horn death is the necessary cure for hybris
- Hero and dragon 
	- "before the ego can triumph, it must master and assimilate the shadow"
		- shadow is the dark side of the personality, remains unconscious, the hero must realise the shadow exists and that he can draw strength from it
- A journey alone can represent transcendence, so do birds, snakes, rodents, lizards and sometimes fish
