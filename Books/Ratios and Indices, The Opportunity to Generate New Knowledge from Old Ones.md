## Different Ratio Numbers
$$
Reference \; Number = \frac{Parameter \; A}{Paramter \; B}
$$
- example is the gross domestic product per capita
$$
Quota = \frac{Share \; parameter}{Total \; parameter}
$$
$$
Dynamic \; index_t = \frac{Value \; of \; the \; parameter \; at \; time \; point \; t}{Value \; of \; the \; parameter \; at \; the \; starting \; point}
$$
- dynamic index is good if we want to analyse the development of one quantity
## Price and Quantity Index of Laspeyres and Paasche
- want to look at the development of several variables
$$
P_{Lt} = \frac{\sum{p_{ti} \times q_{0i}}}{\sum{p_{0i} \times q_{0i}}} \times 100
$$

- where:
	- $P_{Lt}$ denotes the Laspeyres price index at time t
	- $p_{ti}$ is the price of good $i$ at time $t$
	- $p_{0i}$ is the price of good $i$ at the base time $0$
	- $q_{0i}$ is the quantity of good $i$ at base time $0$
$$
P_{Pt} = \frac{\sum{p_{ti} \times q_{ti}}}{\sum{p_{0i} \times q_{ti}}} \times 100
$$

- where:
	- $P_{Pt}$ denotes the Paasche price index at time t
	- $p_{ti}$ is the price of good $i$ at time $t$
	- $p_{0i}$ is the price of good $i$ at the base time $0$
	- $q_{0i}$ is the quantity of good $i$ at base time $0$
- Laspeyres is good as it can be comparable over time
- Paasche is good as it takes into account the situation of today
- quantity development can also be calculated by basically just switching round the $p$ and the $q$ in the formulas, producing $Q_{Lt}$ for the Laspeyres quantity index at time $t$
