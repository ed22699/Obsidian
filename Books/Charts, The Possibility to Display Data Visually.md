## The Frequency Table
- with nominal and ordinal data, only a few specific values occur and we can enter the values directly into the table
- with metric data, usually we have a lot of different values, i.e. first we have to classify them
- frequency density: $f_i* = \frac {f_i}{w_i}$ where $w_i$ is the class width

### Excel
- set the class borders and label the table
- select all cells for which we want to have the frequency, then click on the formulas tab
- to fill out the rest hold control, shift return whilst the rest of the row is selected
## The Frequency Charts
- three possibilities:
	- absolute frequency chart
	- relative frequency chart
	- histogram
- for different class widths histograms are better
- absolute frequency plot and relative frequency plot are easier to interpret
