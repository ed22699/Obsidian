- help to see patterns in the data, or give hints about the behaviour of people or objects
## The Frequency Table
- with nominal and ordinal data, only a few specific values occur and we can enter the values directly into the table
- with metric data, usually we have a lot of different values, i.e. first we have to classify them

### Excel
- set the class borders and label the table
- select all cells for which we want to have the frequency, then click on the formulas tab
## The Frequency Charts
- three possibilities:
	- absolute frequency chart
	- relative frequency chart
	- histogram
- for different class widths histograms are better
- absolute frequency plot and relative frequency plot are easier to interpret
