## Colour
- colour leads the viewer's eyes toward the face
### Two colour technique
- first approach: the relationship between the complexion and an outfit's level of contrast
	- the colours of any given ensemble should exhibit the same degree of contrast as that manifested by one's skin and hair tones, a person's two primary colour signposts
		- contrast complexion is more forgiving, can go for darker bolder colours
		- mutes complexion requires the brighter richer colours which cause less contrast
- second approach: highlighting each face by repeating one or more of its natural pigments in the colours worn
	- blondes wearing gold glasses
- if your hair is dark and your skin light, you have a contrast complexion
- if your hair and skin tone are similar, your complexion would be considered muted or tonal
- eye colour follows skin and hair as the next most important facial indicator
	- blue shirt for the blue eyes for example
- the last facial feature to consider is any special pigment such as rosy cheeks or suntanned skin
	- increases contrast, hence why more colourful outfits in the summer
