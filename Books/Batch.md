- **single-piece flow** - a term in lean manufacturing equivalent to making one envelope at a time rather then doing many in stages, counterintuitively this proves to be more efficient. Works because of the surprising power of small batches (batch size of one, batch size being how much work moves from one stage to the next).
	- quality problems can be identified much sooner. Toyota post world war 2 is a good example of single-piece flow
	- can be used for startups to find validated learning
	- goal is to find out quickly if the customer does not want the product
	- continuous deployment ensures these fast single feature batches remain safe to the system as a whole
