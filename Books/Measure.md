- a startup's job is to:
	- rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals
	- devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan
- innovation accounting - enables startups to prove objectively that they are learning how to grow a sustainable business:
	1. use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now
	2. attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal, after the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimisations it can move its baseline toward the ideal. The company reaches a decision point
	3. pivot or persevere
- advertising may not bring in a sustainable flow of people however it brings in *data*, new opportunities to see how independent cohorts react to new features
- measuring requires clear tangible predictions ahead of time that can be measured against
- beware vanity metrics
	- use split-test experiments and cohort metrics 
	- validating features could be a better metric for progress then completing features as it actually gives you a direction in what the customer wants
- reports from these experiments serve as proof of leaning and can be compared in the future to aid direction
