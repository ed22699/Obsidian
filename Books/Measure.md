- a startup's job is to:
	- rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals
	- devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan
- innovation accounting - enables startups to prove objectively that they are learning how to grow a sustainable business:
	1. use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now
	2. attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal, after the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimisations it can move its baseline toward the ideal. The company reaches a decision point
	3. pivot or persevere
