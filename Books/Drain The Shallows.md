- plan the day, set your tasks and the time they will take, if you think they may take longer then predicted you can either:
	- adapt the schedule as the day goes on
	- leave periods after this task for a non important shallow task, that can be replaced by more of this task
- Give yourself a deep work to shallow work ratio and try to stick to it, e.g. 70% of time for deep work 30% for shallow
