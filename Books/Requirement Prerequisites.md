- The goal of preparation is risk reduction. The most common project risks are poor requirements and project planning
- you need to complete requirements and planning before beginning code as error will be more costly with requirements are not defined
- iterative approaches reduce the effects of poor planning however do not eliminate them

**Do sequential when:**
- requirements are fairly stable
- design is straightforward and fairly well understood
- development team is familiar with the applications area
- project contains little risk
- long-term predictability is important
- cost of changing requirements, design, and code downstream is likely to be high
**Do iterative when:**
- requirements are not well understood or you expect them to be unstable 
- design is complex, challenging, or both
- development team is unfamiliar with the applications area
- project contains a lot of risk
- long-term predictability is not important
- the cost of changing requirements, design, and code downstream is likely to be low

- problem definition is writing describing the problem. This should not include technical terms and should be in the users perspective, it should not hint at any solutions or try to guide people towards a certain solution, this should only be 1 to 2 pages

**Requirements are important as:**
- they keep the user in the loop, they can look over these requirements and agree to them, undefined requirements can result in programmers assuming requirements during the coding process. Explicit requirements help show what the user wants.
- reduces arguments between programmers as they can refer back to these requirements 
- leads to less required changes
- the users requirements will change around 25% during construction which results in 70-85% of the rework on a typical project
