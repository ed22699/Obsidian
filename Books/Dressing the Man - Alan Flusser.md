description: "Dressing the Man is the definitive guide to what men need to know in order to dress well and look stylish without becoming fashion victims. Alan Flusser's name is synonymous with taste and style. With his new book, he combines his encyclopedic knowledge of men's clothes with his signature wit and elegance to address the fundamental paradox of modern men's fashion: Why, after men today have spent more money on clothes than in any other period of history, are there fewer well-dressed men than at any time ever before? According to Flusser, dressing well is not all that difficult, the real challenge lies in being able to acquire the right personalized instruction. Dressing well pivots on two pillars -- proportion and color. Flusser believes that &quot;Permanent Fashionability,&quot; both his promise and goal for the reader, starts by being accountable to a personal set of physical trademarks and not to any kind of random, seasonally served-up collection of fashion flashes. Unlike fashion, which is obliged to change each season, the face's shape, the neck's height, the shoulder's width, the arm's length, the torso's structure, and the foot's size remain fairly constant over time. Once a man learns how to adapt the fundamentals of permanent fashion to his physique and complexion, he's halfway home. Taking the reader through each major clothing classification step-by-step, this user-friendly guide helps you apply your own specifics to a series of dressing options, from business casual and formalwear to pattern-on-pattern coordination, or how to choose the most flattering clothing silhouette for your body type and shirt collar for your face. A man's physical traits represent his individual road map, and the quickest route toward forging an enduring style of dress is through exposure to the legendary practitioners of this rare masculine art. Flusser has assembled the largest andmost diverse collection of stylishly mantled men ever found in one book. Many never-before-seen vintage photographs from the era of Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire are employed to help illustrate the range and diversity of authentic men's fashion. Dressing the Man's sheer magnitude of options will enable the reader to expand both the grammar and verbiage of his permanent-fashion vocabulary. For those men hoping to find sartorial fulfillment somewhere down the road, tethering their journey to the mind-set of permanent fashion will deliver them earlier rather than later in life."

key points: 
## Colour
- colour leads the viewer's eyes toward the face
### Two colour technique
- first approach: the relationship between the complexion and an outfit's level of contrast
	- the colours of any given ensemble should exhibit the same degree of contrast as that manifested by one's skin and hair tones, a person's two primary colour signposts
		- contrast complexion is more forgiving, can go for darker bolder colours
		- mutes complexion requires the brighter richer colours which cause less contrast
- second approach: highlighting each face by repeating one or more of its natural pigments in the colours worn
	- blondes wearing gold glasses
- if your hair is dark and your skin light, you have a contrast complexion
- if your hair and skin tone are similar, your complexion would be considered muted or tonal
- eye colour follows skin and hair as the next most important facial indicator
	- blue shirt for the blue eyes for example
- the last facial feature to consider is any special pigment such as rosy cheeks or suntanned skin
	- increases contrast, hence why more colourful outfits in the summer
## Proportion
### The Suit Jacket
- jackets shoulders frame the head
	- too narrow, head will appear larger than actual size
	- too wide, head will appear disproportionately small
- jacket length
	- long enough to cover the curvature of the buttocks while giving the leg as long a line as possible
	- jacket length in relation to the torso: divide in half the distance from the collar's seam to the floor
	- jacket length in relation to the arm: jacket's bottom should line up with thumb knuckle 
- the waist button
	- functions as an axis
		- raise too much and the torso becomes abbreviated
		- lower too much and the torso is elongated at the expense of a longer leg line
	- when fastened should divide the body so that the torso and legs appear at maximum length
	- should be 1/2 inch below the natural waist
- the gorge and lapel width
	- gorge - point where collar and lapel meet to form either a steplike notch or a pointed peak effect
		- its function should be of ones build
		- too low and the truncated lapel's line makes the short man appear shorter and the heavy man look heavier
		- taller man's lapel notches can rest a bit lower in the chest area, condensing the upper body's length while extending its breadth
	- to smoothly escort the viewer's eyes towards the face the jacket's lapels and the necktie's width should harmonise
		- breadth of the jacket's shoulder guides the lapels width
		- broad-shouldered man will naturally require a fuller lapel for proper balance
		- the single-breasted lapel should cover between two-fifths and three-fifths of the distance between the jacket's chest and shoulder line
			- results in the average notch lapel measuring from $3 \frac 38$ inches to $4 \frac 1 4$ inches in width
		- peaked lapels need more breadth to accommodate their upsweep design, they should not be so broad as to become conspicuous
- the jacket sleeve
	- properly cut jacket sleeves lend a trim, well-formed grace to the arm
	- full at the top or sleevehead and tapering down to the wrist bone
	- sleeves converging lines should conform to the broad shoulder and narrowing waist of the jacket
	- the band of linen between jacket sleeve and hand is good
### The Suit Trouser
- should extend the line of the jacket
	- fuller-chested jackets require fuller-cut trousers
	- more fitted jackets mandate slimmer-fitting trousers
- should be worn on the waist, not the hip
	- makes waist appear smaller
	- better fill up the jacket's bottom opening, thereby lengthening the overall figure
### The Dress Shirt
- shirt collar frames the face
	- smaller man with delicate features requires a collar of restrained dimensions
### The Necktie
- widths determined by the jacket's lapel
	- narrow shoulders, narrower lapel so narrower tie width
	- broad-shouldered man requires more generous lapel and so a larger-scaled necktie
- the secret of tie aesthetics lies in compressing the knot so that it can dovetail high up into the inverted V of the collar's converging sides
	- to enhance its staying power, a dimple or inverted pleat should emerge from under the middle of the knot
	- if knot not taut, it will not have the necessary spring to arch out form the collar
### The Pocket Handkerchief
- one way to ensure a natural effect is to angle the hank outward toward the shoulder, with its points irregularly arranged
	- echoes the slant of the jacket's lapel, reinforcing breadth of the wearer's chest and upper body
### The Tailored ankle
- rule of thumb is that the trouser bottom should cover about two thirds of the shoe
- narrow trouser bottoms make larger feet loom even larger
- wide trouser bottoms make a small foot appear even smaller
### Proportions and body type
- short and heavy men
	- to elongate the figure, the eye needs to be distracted from the waistline and led north to the shoulders and south below the knees. Vertical stripes help that
	- larger men should have clothes hang loose
	- short men usually have legs proportionally short in relation to their torso. 
		- jacket must create the impression that the leg line is actually longer than it really is. Jacket length needs to be kept on the short side, but still cover the seat of his pants
		- can also optically elevate torso by raising the shoulder line. Higher shoulder gives illusion of elevating the torso while elongating the leg line
		- single breasted, two-button jacket with a medium V that opens down to the waist is more flattering to the short figure than the higher, closed fronts of the three-button coat
		- lapel notches should rest high on the upper chest, for a longer lapel line
		- peaked lapels with upswept pointed ends accentuate vertically more than the notched variety
		- sleeves should taper down to the wrist bone so no unnecessary bulk
		- wait trouser on natural waist not below it
		- belt interrupts vertical flow making you look shorter
	- heavy men
		- avoid jackets with stubby or short-rolled lapels, accentuate breadth
		- slanting lines minimise rotundity. Double breasted diagonally running lapels lead the eye away from the centre of the torso and their up-curving pointed ends elongate and narrow the frame
	- jacket detailing less is more, extra flaps bulk up and shorten lines
	- should promote a straighter line at the back, hanging from the shoulders with minimal contour on the waist
	- in terms of patterns, solids and vertical patterns	
	- medium to dark colours and one colour from top to bottom
- short slim man
	- the thin physique should always dress large
	- can entertain more definition to the torso, needs more breadth across his shoulders and chest and fullness in the upper trouser
	- single-breasted, three-button jacket, so would the double-breasted model with lapels rolled below the waist 
	- patch pockets add weight to the jacket's proportionally smaller hip
	- can wear lighter colours
- tall man
	- needs to produce more horizontal lines 
	- long jacket for tall man
	- jacket's shoulders should slope gently downward
	- the tall man's jacket shoulders should pitch forward ever so slightly, contributing to the suppleness and softness encircling his upper strata
	- can wear any jacket, double-breasted are helpful to build out a man with the horizontal thrust of their lapels. Single-breasted, three-button jacket with generous width notch lapels that sit a fraction low on the chest are also good
	- belts and pockets stop the vertical sweeps, can look good
	- trousers should be long in the rise and tailored with deep, forward-facing pleats, don't position below the natural waistline
	- small-patterned clothes serve to exaggerate the tall man's length, for natural proportions need larger-scaled patterns, preferably those having weight and texture to them
	- if stripes make sure they have width, checks, overplaids, and boxlike designs are also good
- athletic build
	- measures 8 inches or more than his waist
	- with the V-shaped torso, the goal is to forge a more architecturally harmonious relationship between the highly upholstered upper half of the body and the disproportionately smaller lower half, without sacrificing the overall athletic image
	- jacket's shoulders must be soft and natural-looking as possible
	- jacket length should err slightly on the long side, but must not shorten the legs line
	- single-breasted, two-button model with generous lapels positioned on the upper chest will play down the shoulder's breadth
	- avoid unnecessary waist suppression
	- sleeve should taper gently downward to the wrist
	- jacket detailing should be kept at a minimum to accentuate the vertical line, although flap or patch pockets can add weight to the hip for a better balance with the shoulder
	- trouser should cut as full around the hip and thigh as possible, fitting as high on the waist as comfortable
	- trousers should taper down to a cuffed bottom that rests on the shoe with some break, pulling the eye all the way down to the floor
	- fuller-scale footwear plus the cuff's mass aid in countering the upside-down pyramid effect
	- smooth-faced fabrics, such as worsted stripes, herringbones, and even windowpanes longer in length and width
	- vertical-pointing dress shirt collars, such as tabs or straight points are good
### The fitting room
- make sure you have your wallet keys and phone in the normal pockets, so when fitted they won't be prominent
- also wear a shirt with the correct sleeve length and collar height to help the fitting
- dress shoes with the proper heel height can aid in establishing the correct trouser length and bottom width
- look out for bounding behind the collar and a gap behind the collar. Also look out for lapels need to lie flat without gapping open
- should not be wrinkle free, needs sufficient fullness over the shoulder blades for a slight break, or fold of fabric, to extend up the back from below the armholes, folds ensure mobility and comfort
- watch that the collar does not stand away or have horizontal ridges below the base of the neck, a sign a collar must be lowered by cutting away excess fabric under the collar
