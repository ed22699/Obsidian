- for a NMP don't overbuild or overpromise, early adopters prefer unpolished and they will be the people who validate your early assumptions
- MVP forms:
	- a video of the product can be a form of MVP
	- Build the product without code for a few people and slowly automate as it is validated
	- wizard of oz prototype
- Remove all features that do not answer the question the MVP is asking
- Reasons people have for not releasing MVP
	- patient protection
	- legal
	- reputation - release MVP under an alias 
	- competition - no one cares 
- when assumptions are proved wrong don't stop, instead *pivot*
