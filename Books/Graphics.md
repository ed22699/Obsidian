## Art Assets
- an individual unit of visual information used by the game

| Type of art asset | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 2D image          | flat pictures. To make a real-world analogy, 2D images are like paintings and photographs                                                                                                      |
| 3D model          | 3D virtual objects. To make a real-world analogy, 3D models are like sculptures                                                                                                                |
| Material          | A packet of information that defines the surface properties of any object that the material is attached to. These surface properties can include colour, shininess, and even subtle roughness  |
| Animation         | Packets of information that define the movement of the associated object. These are detailed movement sequences created ahead of time, as opposed to code that calculates positions on the fly |
| Particle system   | An orderly mechanism for creating and controlling large numbers of small moving objects. Many visual effects, like fire, smoke. or spraying water, are created this way                        |
- Materials and particle systems are created within Unity, but the other art assets are created using external software
- Whiteboxing is blocking out the walls of the scene with blank geometry
	- closely associated with level design (the discipline of planning and creating scenes/levels in a game)
	- this is the foundation in which you typically build up from
- A floor plan is the simple layout of the level
