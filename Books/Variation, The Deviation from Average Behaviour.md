- variation determines how meaningful the average actually is
## The Range
- simplest measure of variation
- calculated from ordinal and metric data
## The Standard Deviation
- the average deviation of individual observations from the mean
- assumes metric data
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar x)^2}}{n-1}}
$$
- when data is prepared in a classified way we alter the formula to 
$$
s \approx \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(\bar x_j- \bar x)^2\times n_j}}{n-1}}
$$
## The Variance
$$
var = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar x)^2}}{n-1}
$$
## The Coefficient of Variation
- used when we compare the variation of two variables, when we wonder in which variable objects have the larger deviation or are less consistent. 
- Measures the variation relatively, as a percentage of the mean
$$
cv = \frac {s} {\bar x} \times 100
$$
	- $cv$ is the coefficient of variation
	- $s$ is the standard deviation
	- $\bar x$ is the mean
## The Interquartile Range
- for both metric data and ordinal data
- informs about the area in which the middle 50% of the values are located
## The Boxplot
- combines the information on the median, the first and third quartiles as well as the minimum and maximum values
