## Play your best line
- if collar too small the head will appear large
- if the collar sits too low it will make the neck look longer than it is
- the length and spread of the collar points should complement the head's contour and size
	- long straight-point collars, those 3 inches or more, with little spread between their points will extend the narrow a wide countenance
	- broadly spaced points of a spread collar will counterbalance a long and narrow face
- should counterbalance the facial structure by either softening its dominant lines or strengthening its weak ones
## The straight-point collar
- collar points should finish between 2 3/4 inches and 3 3/8 inches in length
- narrow opening between its points favours a rounder, oval-shaped face rather than a narrow one
## The Spread Collar
- as they vary in height, point length, and openness, there are models for any head shape or profile
- should be a permanent fixture in every mans wardrobe
## The Rounded Collar
- more victorian society
## The Tab Collar
- special tabs fasten to each other under the tie's knot to hold the collar's point in place, thrusting the shirt collar and necktie knot higher up under the wearer's chin
	- long necked men welcome this higher positioning
## Pinned Collars
- like the tab, it raises the tie knot up on the neck
- straight point's vertically work to counterpoint the rounded or oval contoured head or chin
- pinned with plain gold safety pin or spring-loaded slide mechanism
- its softer, rounder outline harmonises well with the square or angular jawline
## Button-Down Collar
## Fitting the dress shirt
- with top button closed, two fingers should be able to slide comfortably between the neck and the collar of a new shirt
	- want it to be slightly large as it will shrink after the first few washes
- should not be tension across the waist
- should be able to raise your arms without pulling out of the trouser top
- when necktie is worn, collar's points should remain in touch with the shirt's body
	- cutaway collars should not have space above the tie knot, with points long enough to be covered by the jacket's neckline
	- no part of the collar's neckband should peek out over the tie's knot
- shirt fit snugly around wrist so that the additional length required to keep the cuff from pulling back when the arm is extended does not force it down the hand
	- shirt cuff and hand should move as one
	- if the hand can slide through the cuff opening without first unfastening it, the cuff's circumference is too large
## Dress Shirt Modes
- the spirited dress shirt alternative can lend smartness to the tailored scenario without compromising the boundaries of good taste
## Dress shirt aesthetics
- pairing fabrics matter
- the stiffer the collar the more formal the intentions
- more open collar's points, the dressier the presentation
- softer collar configurations such as the button-down or unstarched long point rank lower in formality
- formality begins at the collar, then the cuffs, then the fabric
- smoother or more lustrous materials are more dressy
## Solid-Colour Dress Shirt
- medium blue actually flatters more men's faces than white
	- white can drain away colour
	- blue enlivens skin tone
- find the deepest shade of blue that highlights the face without distracting from it
	- faired hair man will have lighter tones of blue
	- can increase the tone of blue when you have a summer tan
## The Patterned Dress Shirt
- amount of contrast found in the complexion will dictate the degree of contrast below
