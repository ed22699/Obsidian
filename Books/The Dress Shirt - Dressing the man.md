## Play your best line
- if collar too small the head will appear large
- if the collar sits too low it will make the neck look longer than it is
- the length and spread of the collar points should complement the head's contour and size
	- long straight-point collars, those 3 inches or more, with little spread between their points will extend the narrow a wide countenance
	- broadly spaced points of a spread collar will counterbalance a long and narrow face
- should counterbalance the facial structure by either softening its dominant lines or strengthening its weak ones
## The straight-point collar
- collar points should finish between 2 3/4 inches and 3 3/8 inches in length
- narrow opening between its points favours a rounder, oval-shaped face rather than a narrow one
