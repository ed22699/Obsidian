## the Test Distribution and Test Statistic
$$
z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\sigma _{\bar x}}
$$
- $z$ is the $z$-value of the standard normal distribution
- $\bar x$ is the sample mean
- $\mu$ is the population mean assumed in the null hypothesis
- $\sigma_{\bar x}$ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution with $\sigma_{\bar x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$ 
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation in the population 
- $n$ is the number of observations
## The Critical Value
- we determine the critical value, and thus the rejection area, using the standard normal distribution table
## The $z$-value
- we calculate the $z$-value using the test statistic
- insert the sample mean, the mean from the null hypothesis, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
## The Decision
- compare our $z$-value with the critical values
