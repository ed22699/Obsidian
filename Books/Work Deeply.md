- make it a habit, build it into your daily routine
- there are many different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule and you need to do that one fit for your circumstances:
	- Cut out all possible forms of shallow work
	- have periods of either your week of year dedicated to deep work where no shallow work occurs 
	- have a daily schedule where this deep work becomes a habit, and occurs at a consistent time each day
	- Just work deeply when you have spare moments
- rituals are important to help slip into deep work quickly:
	- ask yourself where you'll work and for how long
	- how you'll work once you start to work
	- how you'll support your work (food, exercise, drink)
- use of grand gestures to internally inflate the importance of the task and effort/money was possibly laid down to create the environment to which to complete the task
- expose yourself to ideas in hubs on regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply
- collaboration can sometime push us into a deeper state of work
- The what and how is different, you can know what you need to do, the strategy in play but how to execute it is different (4DX):
	- focus on the wildly important: set a few ambitious goals to complete within deep work
	- Act on the lead measures: lead measures measure new behaviours that will drive success on the lag measures (the things you are trying to improve)
	- Keep a compelling scoreboard 
	- Create a cadence of accountability 
- maintain a clear endpoint in your workday:
	- idle time is good as it allows your subconscious to produce sometimes better insights on problems which require vast knowledge to be drawn from the mind
	- giving rest time where you can shut down, such as walks in nature, improve your attention restoration
	- the work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important
		- in deliberate practice the limit for intense concentration is around an hour for a novice and around 4 hours for an expert but rarely more
- create a shutdown ritual to tell your mind that work is done for the day
	- my ritual:
		- read
		- set up tomorrows plan
		- SCOO
