## The Random Sample: The Best Estimator for Our Population
- when collecting data we must clarify the following
	- who is the population or about whom do we want to make a statement
	- do we conduct a census or a random sampling
	- if we conduct a random sampling, how do we achieve that the sample is representative of the population
	- how large should the sample be
- a sample is a subset of the population
	- the sample must behave in exactly the same way as the population with regard to the subject of the study
	- for this we draw the sample randomly out of the population
