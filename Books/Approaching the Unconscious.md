- **What is a symbol?**: "A word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning", "has a wider unconscious aspect that is never precisely defined or fully explained"
- **Conscious perception is limited by the senses**: "At some point he reaches the edge of certainty beyond when conscious knowledge cannot pass"
	- **Reality is translated into the mind**: "Every concrete object is always unknown in a certain respects, because we cannot know the ultimate nature of matter itself"
	- **Certain events are missed by our conscious** and their emotional/vital **importance later wells up from the unconscious through intuition** and afterthoughts - symbolism of dreams
- "We too can become disassociated and lose our identity, we can be possessed and altered by moods"
	- "An ability to control ones emotions that may be very desirable from one point of view would be a questionable accomplishment from another, for it would deprive social intarcorse of variety, colour and warmth"
- **The unconscious mind expresses itself through dreams**
- **Free Association**: 
	- One action/activity triggers the thoughts of another. This is more of Freuds view on dreams
	- The uprising of complex emotional themes can come from any point be it thought, meditation or dreams. But dreams arise from the emotional upset in the tender spots of our psyche making it a good vessel to the critical secret of thoughts
	- Jung's opinion on dreams being a form of free association - dreams have a purposeful structure indicating an underlying intention. Rather than using free association it can easily be reached by other means
		- Jung argues we should focus on the associations of the dreams themselves as they are a more specific expression from ones unconscious
		- "The dream has its own limitation. Its specific form itself tells us what belongs to it and what leads away from it"
- **There is so much in day to day that not everything can remain in the conscious, however it is still stored and processed by the unconscious with the ability to surface**: "But when something slips out of our consciousness it does not cease to exist ... we come across thoughts that were temporarily lost to us"
	- "Part of the unconscious consists of a multitude of temporarily obscured thoughts, impressions and images that, in spite of being lost, continue to influence our conscious minds"
	- "Unconscious contents of the mind behave as if they were conscious \[we cannot be sure if an\] action is conscious or not"
- **Repressed contents**: "Where pride is insistent enough, memory prefers to give way. Thus, among the lost memories, we encounter not a few that owe their subliminal state to their disagreeable and incompatible nature" - Nietzsche
- "One must learn to discriminate carefully between intentional and unintentional contents of the mind. The former are derived from the ego personality; the latter, however, arise from a source that is not identical with the ego, but is its 'other side'"
- **The unconscious is complex and vast in its abilities** and so the symbols within dreams can have subliminal material that "can consist of all urges, impulses and intentions; all perceptions and intuitions; all rational and irrational thoughts, conclusions, inductions, deductions and premises; and all varieties of feeling" 
- Jung argues that **genius is the ability to reach the thoughts and ideas created by our unconscious and "translate it effectively into philosophy, literature, music or scientific discovery"**
- "One finds that dreams present images and associations that are analogous to primitive ideas, myths and rites", Freud called them "archaic remnants", Jung argues they are not remnants and are instead still of high importance in their symbolism 
	- He also argues that words in the waking world have primitive symbolism/meaning that has since been stripped but the absurdity of dreams dresses this primitive meaning in ways that are harder to ignore
