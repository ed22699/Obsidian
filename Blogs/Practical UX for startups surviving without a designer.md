key points:
## Blank pages are a trap
- bigger teams have thought about the big design questions, copy them
- **avoid looking at**:
	- design award websites: they showcase originality, not proven usability
	- dribble: prioritises aesthetics over functions
- **look at**:
	- competitor sites: make accounts, take screenshots
		- if you can't find competitors zoom out the question
	- aggregators like PageFlows or Mobbin for quick reference
- take notes on:
	- common UI elements like email, password fields, confirmation flows
	- visual and layout conventions (centred forms, responsive design, clear buttons, logos at the top)
## Be explicit about your goal
- asking the right questions keeps you focused on what matters
## Think about edge cases
- ask what could go wrong
	- take it field by field
	- zoom out and look across the entire flow
## Use AI to spot blind spots
- prompts to try:
	- red team vs blue team: "critique this sign-up flow: where could users get stuck?" vs "defend this design: what makes it intuitive?"
	- industry standards: "how do top SaaS companies design their sign-up flows?"
	- edge cases: "what happens if a user mistypes their email but doesn't notice"
## Tips
- decide what you're going to measure, good UX might mean conversion rate, user-retention or user satisfaction
- keep your colours simple. One primary, one secondary and one accent colour
- keep the language familiar to the users, not to the people building it
