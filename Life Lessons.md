# Coding
- When training models or doing large tasks try to leverage your GPU it will be so much faster to run then your CPU
- When doing time consuming tasks, if possible save what they do either in the loop or straight after. If there are multiple time consuming tasks in the same file, split them up, the saving means you won't need to run each big task when you're working on the next
