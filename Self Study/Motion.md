## Providing feedback
- strive for realistic feedback motion that follows people's gestures and expectations
- Aim for brevity and precision in feedback animations
- In apps, generally avoid adding motion to UI interactions that occur frequently
- Let people cancel motions. Don't make people wait for an animation to complete
- Consider using animated symbols where it makes sense
