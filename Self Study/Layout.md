## Adaptability
- need to handle:
	- different screen sizes, resolutions and colour spaces
	- different orientations
	- system features like dynamic island and camera controls
	- dynamic type text-size changes
	- locale-based internationalisation features like left-to-right/right-to-left layout direction, date/time/number formatting, font variation and text length
- design a layout that adapts gracefully to context changes while remaining recognisably consistent
- be prepared for text-size changes
- preview your app on multiple devices, using different orientations, localisations, and text sizes
- when necessary, scale artwork in response to display changes
