- Request access only to data that you actually need
- Be transparent about how your app collects and uses people's data
- Process data on the device where possible
- Adopt system-defined privacy protections and follow security best practices
## Requesting Permission
- need to request permission for calendar data, device capabilities like camera and microphone, the device's advertising identifier, which supports app tracking
- Request permission only when your app clearly needs access to the data or resource
- Avoid requesting permission at launch unless the data or resource is required for your app to function
- Write copy that clearly describes how your app uses the ability, data, or resource you're requesting
## Pre-alert screens, windows, or views
- Include only one button and make it clear that it opens the system alert. Don't use the term like "Allow", instead use "Continue" or "Next"
- Don't include additional actions in your custom screen or window
## Tracking requests
- Never precede the system-provided alert with a custom screen or window that could confuse or mislead people
## Location button
- Consider using the location button to give people a lightweight way to share their location for specific app features
- Consider customising the location button to harmonise with your UI
