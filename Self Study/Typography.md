## Ensuring legibility
- use font sizes that most people can read easily (minimum 11pt)
- support dynamic type
- test legibility in different contexts
- in general, avoid light font weights
## Conveying hierarchy
- adjust font weight, size and colour as needed to emphasise important information and help people visualise hierarchy
- minimise the number of typefaces you use, even in a highly customised interface
- prioritise important content when responding to text-size changes
## Using system fonts
- consider using the built-in text styles
- modify the built-in text styles if necessary
- if necessary, adjust tracking in interface mockups
## Using custom fonts
- make sure custom fonts are legible
- implement accessibility features for custom fonts
