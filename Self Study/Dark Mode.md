- avoid offering an app-specific appearance setting
- ensure your app looks good in both appearance models
- test your content remains legible in both appearance modes
## Dark Mode colours
- aim for sufficient colour contrast in all appearances (minimum contrast ration is no lower than 4.5:1, for custom foreground and background colours aim for 7:1)
- Soften the colour of white backgrounds
## Icons and images
- Use SF symbols wherever possible
- Design separate interface icons for the light and dark appearances if necessary
- Make sure full-colour images and icons look good in both appearances
## Text
- Use the system-provided label colour for labels
- Use system views to draw text fields and text views
## iOS
- in dark mode they system uses two sets of background colours called base and elevated
	- base colours are dimmer, making background interfaces appear to recide
	- elevated colours are brighter, making foreground interfaces appear to advance
	- Prefer the system background colours
