# Colour
- **Hue**: the colour you pick from the wheel
	- 120 = green
	- 240 = blue
- **Saturation**: how strong 
	- 100% = bright, pure and full
	- 50% = grey mixed in with it
	- 0% = only grey
- **Lightness**: how much light the colour has got in it
	- 0% is very dark
	- 50% is in the middle
	- 100% is very light 
## Colour Schemes
- **Monochromatic**: take one hue and create other design elements from shades and tints of this single colour
- **Analogous**: take three colours that are next to each other on the colour wheel and use them
- **Complementary**: use opposite colour pairs like blue and yellow  
	- maximises contrast
- **Split-complementary**: uses colours from either side of your complementary colour pair. Select the colours immediately adjacent to the opposite colour
	- soften the contrast
- **Triadic**: three colours that are equally distant on the colour wheel
	- effective for harmony and high contrast
- **Tetradic**:use four colours that form two sets of complementary pairs but have one colour dominating
- **Square**: variant of tetradic, with four colours evenly spaced on the colour wheel
## Psychology of colour
- **Red**: split perceptions from place to place; can carry overtones of *danger, revolution, passion, or sexiness* in the West, connotes *happiness or good fortune* in the east
- **Blue**: *peaceful or calming* colour, but carries *conservative and authoritative* meanings in the west, but can combine to to give the *sense of trust*
- **White**: *purity and innocence* in the west, *death or the supernatural* in the east
- Red: love, passion, strength, power, danger, excitement, energy
- Orange: warmth, creativity, adventure, freshness, happiness, attraction, success
- Yellow: optimism, cheer, happiness, warmth, caution, energy, intellect
- Green: nature, growth, wealth, luck, envy, freshness, quality
- Blue: trust, calm, sadness, peace, loyalty, depth, authenticity
- Purple: royalty, nobility, wisdom, luxury, imagination, mystery, spirituality
- White: purity, simplicity, innocence, pease, cleanliness, emptiness, goodness
- Black: sophistication, formality, sorrow, boldness, elegance, death, mystery
## Create colour pallet
1. choose primary, secondary, and accent/supplementary colours wisely
	- primary should appear most often - colour most strongly associated with the brand
	- secondary and accent colours highlight and distinguish different parts of the interface - need to work well with primary colour choice
	- *contrast*, needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal and 3:1 for large text
	- *avoid absolute white or black*: can strain the eyes due to their extreme contrast
2. follow the 60-30-10 rule
	- the proportions split between primary, secondary, and accent colours respectively
3. understand your audience 
4. use photos to create your pallet
	- nature and architecture can be great inspirational sources
5. use contrast effectively
	- too much can make a UI hard to scan
