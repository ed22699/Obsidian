- SF symbols support the following rendering modes
	- Monochrome - applies one colour to all layers in a symbol
	- Hierarchical - applies one colour to all layers in a symbol, varying the colour's opacity according to each layer's hierarchical level
	- Palette -Applies two or more colours to a symbol, using one colour per layer
	- Multicolour - applies intrinsic colours to some symbols to enhance meaning
- Confirm that a symbol's rendering mode works well in every context
## Variable colour
- use variable colour to communicate change - don't use it to communicate depth (to convey depth and visual hierarchy use Hierarchical rendering mode to elevate certain layers )
## Animations
- SF symbols 5 and later support the following animations:
	- *appear*: causes a symbol to gradually emerge into view
	- *disappear*: causes a symbol to gradually recede out of view
	- *bounce*: briefly scales a symbol with an elastic-like movement that goes either up or down and then returns to the symbol's initial state
		- can help communicate that an action occurred or needs to take place
	- *scale*: changes the size of a symbol, increasing or decreasing its scale.Unlike bounce, scale persists until set a new scale or remove effect.
		- use to draw people's attention to selected item or as feedback when people choose a symbol
	- *pulse*: varies the opacity of a symbol with time
		- use to communicate ongoing activity
	- *Variable colour*: incrementally varies the opacity of layers within a symbol. Can be cumulative or iterative
		- use to communicate progress
	- *replace*: replaces one symbol with another
		- down-up: outgoing symbol scales down and the incoming symbol scales up (communicating change in state)
		- up-up: both outgoing and incoming symbols scale up (communicates change in state that includes a sense of forward progression)
		- off-up: outgoing symbol hides immediately and incoming symbol scales up (communicates a state change that emphasises the next available state or action)
	- *magic replace*: smart transition between two symbols with related shapes. Is default replace animation
- SF symbols 6 and later support:
	- *Wiggle*: moves symbol back and forth along a directional axis
	- *breathe*: smoothly increases and decreases the presence of a symbol
	- *rotate*: rotates the symbol to act as a visual indicator or imitate an object's behaviour in real world
- apply symbol animations judiciously. Too many can overwhelm an interface
- make sure that animations serve a clear purpose in communicating a symbol's intent
- use symbol animations to communicate information more efficiently
- consider your app's tone when adding animations
## Custom symbols
- use the template as a guide: simple, recognisable, inclusive, directly related to the action or content it represents
- assign negative side margins to your custom symbol if necessary
- optimise layers to use animations with custom symbols
- test animations for custom symbols
- avoid making custom symbols that include common variants, such as enclosures or badges
- provide alternative text labels for custom symbols
- don't design replicas of apple products
