- approximately one in seven people have a disability that affects the way they interact with the world and their devices
- prioritising *simplicity* and *perceivability* and examining every design decision to ensure that it doesn't  exclude people with disabilities or who interact with their devices in different ways
	- simplicity - support familiar, consistent interactions that make complex tasks simple and straightforward to perform
	- perceivability - make sure that all content can be perceived whether people are using sight, hearing, or tough
- support personalisation
	- Bold text, larger text, invert colours, increase contrast options
- consider using Xcode's *Accessibility Inspector*
- VoiceOver, Assistive Touch, Pointer Control, and Switch Control need to be supported correctly
## Gestures
- *don't override platform gestures*, swiping down should reveal Notification centre regardless of the app
- prefer *simplified gestures* for *common interactions*. Complex gestures such as multifinger or multihand, long presses or gestures that require repeated movements are challenging
- *provide alternative ways to perform gesture-based actions*. Include an option for people who may not be able to perform a specific gesture. e.g. if people can use a gesture to delete a row provide a way to delete items through an edit mode or by offering a Delete button in an item detail view
- when possible app's core functionality should be accessible through more than one type of physical interaction
	- camera can take photo with button or devi
