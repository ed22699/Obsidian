- *Use colour sparingly* in non-game apps
- Avoid using the same colour to mean different things
- Make sure your app's colours work well in both light and dark contexts
- Test your app's colour scheme under a variety of lighting conditions
- Test on different devices
- If your app lets people choose colours, prefer system-provided colour controls where available, see `ColorPicker`
- Consider how the colours you use might be perceived in other countries and cultures
- Avoid hard-coding system colour values in your app, use `Color`
- Avoid replicating dynamic system colours
- Avoid redefining the semantic meanings of dynamic system colours
- Apply colour profiles to your images
## iOS considerations
- use the grouped background colours (`systemGroupedBackground`, `secondarySystemGroupedBackground` and `tertiarySystemGroupedBackground`) when you have a grouped table view
- otherwise, use the system set of background colours (`systemBackground`, `secondarySystemBackground` and `tertiarySystemBackground`)
- with both sets of background colours, you generally use the variants to indicate hierarchy in the following ways:
	- primary for the overall view
	- secondary for grouping content or elements within the overall view
	- tertiary for grouping content or elements within secondary elements
- For foreground content, iOS defined the following dynamic colours:
