- *Unique memorable icon* communicates the purpose and personality of your app, can help people *recognise your product* at a glance in the App Store and on their devices
## Best practices
- *Embrace simplicity*, easier for people to understand and recognise, find concept or element that captures your app and make it core idea of the icon, *avoid too many details*
- Create a design that works well on multiple platforms so it feels at home on each
- Only include text if it's an essential part of your experience or brand
- Prefer *graphical images* to photos and avoid replicating UI component in your icon
- If needed, optimise your icon for the specific sizes the system displays in places like Spotlight search results, settings, and notifications
- Design your icon as a *square image*
- In most cases, design your icon with full edge-to-edge opacity
- Consider offering an alternate app icon in app's settings
- *Don't use replicas of Apple hardware products*
## iOS considerations
- people can customise the appearance of their app icons to be light, dark or tinted. You can create your own variations to ensure that each one looks exactly the way you want
- Design your dark and tinted icons to feel at home next to system app icons and widgets
- Consider a simplified version of your icon that captures its essential features
- Use your light app icon as a basis for your dark icon. Choose complementary colours that reflect the default design, avoid excessively bright images
- *Omit the background* so the system-provided background can show through
- Provide your tinted icon as a grayscale image
- *Don't add an overlay or border to your Settings icon*. iOS automatically adds a 1-pixel stroke to all icons so that they look good on the white background of Settings
## App icon attributes
- use a PNG format and support the following colour spaces:
	- sRGB
	- Gray Gamma 2.2 (grayscale)
- iOS also supports Display P3 (wide-gamut colour)
- iSO is single layer no transparency square asset shape
## App icon sizes
- for the app store, create an app icon that measures 1024x1024 px
- you can let the system automatically scale down your icon to produce other icons
	- if you want custom appearance of the icon at specific sizes you can supply multiple versions such as the following
