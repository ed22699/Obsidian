- *Unique memorable icon* communicates the purpose and personality of your app, can help people *recognise your product* at a glance in the App Store and on their devices
## Best practices
- *Embrace simplicity*, easier for people to understand and recognise, find concept or element that captures your app and make it core idea of the icon, *avoid too many details*
- Create a design that works well on multiple platforms so it feels at home on each
- Only include text if it's an essential part of your experience or brand
- Prefer *graphical images* to photos and avoid replicating UI component in your icon
- If needed, optimise your icon for the specific sizes the system displays in places like Spotlight search results, settings, and notifications
- Design your icon as a *square image*
- In most cases, design your icon with full edge-to-edge opacity
- Consider offering an alternate app icon in app's settings
- *Don't use replicas of Apple hardware products*
