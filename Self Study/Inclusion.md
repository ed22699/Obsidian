## Welcoming language
- consider the tone of your copy from different perspectives
- Pay attention to how you refer to people. Use you and your to address people directly. Indirectly using user or player can make your experience feel distant. Reserve we and our to represent your software or company otherwise it can suggest a personal relationship with people that might be interpreted as insulting or condescending 
- Avoid using specialised or technical terms without defining them
- Replace colloquial expressions with plain language. These are often culture-specific and can be difficult to translate
- Consider carefully before including humour. Humour is subjective
## Being approachable
- present a clear, straightforward interface
## Gender Identity
- avoid unnecessary references to specific genders (don't use his or hers) instead use gender neutral nouns
- if you need to depict a person use a generic non-gendered human image
## People and settings
- portray a range of human characteristics and activities, e.g. a fitness app could feature exercise moves demonstrated by people with different racial backgrounds, body types, ages and physical capabilities. If you need to depict occupations or behaviours, avoid stereotypical representations such as showing only male doctors, female nurses
## Avoiding stereotypes
- assuming family has a husband wife and children is a stereotype
- choose security questions that can be answered by everyone. Not what was your favourite subject in college. 
## Accessibility
- don't assume a disability might prevent someone from wanting to enjoy the experience your software provides
- avoid images and language that exclude people with disabilities
- Take a people first approach when writing about people with disabilities
